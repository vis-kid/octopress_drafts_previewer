## What is Rake?

Thanks to Rails, Rake has become a de facto standard as a Ruby build tool. It’s super popular in the Ruby community. Very early, the team behind Rails decided to use Rake as the builder for Rails itself which meant that in the past when you downloaded Rails, you also needed a copy of Rake. That way it exposed Rake to a lot of people. A little later, it was included into Ruby (1.9) itself.

Rake de facto replaced the Unix utility Make as a build tool in Ruby land. A build tool like Rake is handy for automating tasks of various kinds—a software for managing tasks basically. It is often used for administration tasks in Rails—which is where you most likely have run into it so far—but its use cases are plenty. Some people write their ebooks in Markdown and have set up Rake tasks that convert the relevant files to intermediate HTML files which then in turn get converted into ebook formats for example. Saves a lot of trouble to use Rake for that.

What makes Rake really powerful is that these tasks can relate to one another and can be built on top of each other. Also, since it is written in Ruby, you can write any Ruby code for your tasks. Want to use Ruby libraries in your Rake tasks? No problem! Fun fact, it is the most downloaded [RubyGem](https://rubygems.org/), approaching 100 Mio downloads. So definitely something in your tool belt that you should pay a little more attention to. It was conceived by the late [Jim Weirich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Weirich), a well known and beloved developer, speaker and contributor to the Ruby ecosystem. It’s a beautiful tool really, thanks Jim! RIP!

## Task List

Let’s take a look at some tasks that Rails offers right out of the box. I bet you are a bit surprised of what’s available if you haven’t checked before. In the relevant directory of your app or your Rakefile, you can list them by typing the following into a shell:

``` bash

rake --tasks
 
#or

rake -T

```

Output:

``` bash

rake about                              # List versions of all Rails frameworks and the environment
rake assets:clean[keep]                 # Remove old compiled assets

```

The output in a Rails app is suprisingly plenty, isn’t it? You can find alot more handy tasks than the usual `rake db:migrate` or `rake routes` that we are so familiar with—and run multiple times on a daily basis. On the left you, see the various tasks and on the right what is optionally provided as a description to every rake task. If you want to see the complete list, which among others also includes tasks that lack a description, you need to add an additional flag.

Shell:

``` bash

rake -T -A

#or

```

Surprise, almost three times as much! Take a look at them, play around if you like but commit the highlights to memory for later usage in the future. Checking the tasks to see what’s available might prevent you from reinventing the wheel.

## Getting Started

A Rakefile can have one of the following five appearances:

+ rakefile.rb
+ rakefile 
+ Rakefile
+ Rakefile.rb
+ .rake files

Mostly you will see the plain `Rakefile` version but a framework like Rails needs more complex organization. Use whatever gets your blood flowing. You start by creating a `Rakefile` or files with a `.rake` extension if you wanna split task up logically over multipe files. Then define your tasks inside either of them.

### Custom Rakefile Organization

Rails makes this incredibly easy. It has a Rakefile in the root of your app. It contains the following:

###### Rakefile

``` ruby

require File.expand_path('../config/application', __FILE__)

Rails.application.load_tasks

```

When you have a lot of custom tasks, it makes more sense to split them into discrete `.rake` files and place them in `lib/tasks`. The Rakefile above just loads them but the `lib` directory is a better logical home for the tasks. There is even a Rails generator to automate part of the process. If you type:

###### Shell

``` bash

rails generate some_task

=> create lib/tasks/some_task.rake

```

You will get a Rakefile placed automatically in the right directory. Even the task is already set up for you. Nice! In other projects, not using Rails, you just need to create a `rakelib` directory and place your Rakefiles in there—preferably with `.rake` file extensions. Then create a file called `Rakefile` and all these files are already at your disposal.

### Rake Task Anatomy

###### lib/tasks/some_task.rake

``` ruby

desc 'List versions of all Rails frameworks and the environment'
task :about do
  puts 'Some magic goes in here…'
end

```

For the complete Ruby newbies among you and for people coming from bracket-heavy languages, this is how it would look with parentheses.

``` ruby

desc('List versions of all Rails frameworks and the environment')
task(:about) do
  puts('Some magic goes in here…')
end

```

Looks very weird btw. Just loose the extra parenthesis, nobody writes tasks this way.

We provided a named task `:about` with a description that not only reminds us in the future what we wanted to achieve with particular tasks, but also shows up when we run `rake -T`. Don’t get lazy on this part, it’s probably not worth it.

Right below is the keyword task that defines a new task named `:about`. This can be invoked on the command line via `rake about` which does its magic then. `rake :about` on the other hand will cause Rake to abort, not knowing `“how to build task :about”`. 

Via the `do end` block, we have a lamda and its body specifies what the task does. This is the basic setup a task will need. It offers a lot more options of course, but the overall structure is the same. 

### require / import

###### Some Rakefile

``` ruby

require './whatever.rb'

```

If you need to include other Ruby files or Rakefiles it can easily be achieved by a standard `require` statement.

###### Some Rakefile

``` ruby

import 'whatever.rb'

```

Rake itself provides us with another way to do this—the `import` method. This can be used in any line of the Rakefile. This one will help when you run into trouble because the required file was loaded before the Rakefile finished loading and blew up therefore. The imported file on the other hand will always load after the Rakefile.

### invoke & execute

Sometimes you might want to execute some defined task from your `Task` class manually. For this purpose, you have two methods of the `Rake::Task` class: `execute` and `invoke`.

``` ruby

Rake::Task['some_task'].invoke
Rake::Task['some_task'].execute

```

With the ```Rake::Task['some_task']``` code, we got the ```some_task``` Rake task to execute. It returns an instance of the `Rake::Task` class and then runs any method on it that is available.

## Namespaces

A very cool feature is the ability to namespace your tasks. You probably have used this dozens of times already. When you run `rake db:migrate`, you have made use of the `db` namespace for example. You invoke the task by separating it with a colon `:` from the namespace. Namespaces are a handy way to organize your tasks within in a rake file—it keeps them logically separated. Multiple namespaces like `rake time:zones:all` are fine btw.

Other examples include:

``` bash

rake db:drop 
rake db:seed
rake log:clear
rake spec:views
rake spec:models  
rake db:rollback
rake spec:helpers 
rake spec:features
rake db:schema:load  
rake assets:precompile 
rake db:migrate:status

```

##### Some Rakefile

``` ruby

namespace :db do
  desc 'Migrating some stuff'
  task :migrate do
    ...
  end
end

```

This is the basic setup. In reality it’s much more complicated and can even be nested multiple times. Have a quick peek at the Rails codebase and see for yourself how `rake db:migrate` is [implemented](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/e3a476dba8ad3a016ee6e20c242c81bb7480f6e3/activerecord/lib/active_record/railties/databases.rake#L77). Don’t feel bad if it’s over your head. Just look around, try to discern how it’s structured and move on for now.

## Prerequisites

Another strategy to organize your tasks and to keep them DRY is using prerequisites for executing a task. It’s like a dependency that has to run first before the actual task starts its job. That way you can build up more complex tasks—as complex as you need. But I would recommend not getting too clever and to keep it as simple as possible—and as easy to understand as possible as well.

###### Some Rakefile

``` ruby

task :stop_megalomaniac do
  puts 'Lots of smart talk, car chases and guns fired'
end

task :bond_saves_the_day => :stop_psychotic_megalomaniac do
  puts 'Lots of Dom Pérignon, oysters and bond girl business'
end

```

If you want to rely on multiple tasks, you just stick them into an array. The order in which you place them matters of course.

``` ruby

task :get_mr_wolf do
  puts "You ain’t got no problem Jules, I’m on it! Go in there and chill them out and wait for the wolf who should be coming directly!"
end

task :figure_out_bonnie_situation do
  puts "If I was informed correctly, the clock is ticking. Is that right Jimmy?"
end

task :calm_down_jimmy do
  puts "Jimmy, do me a favor, will you? I smelled some coffee back there. Would you make me a cup?"
end

task :get_vince_vega_in_line do
  puts "Come again? Get it straight buster. I’m not here to say please! I’m here to tell you what to do!"
end

task :clean_car do
  puts "I need you two fellas to take those cleaning products and clean the inside of the car. I’m talking fast, fast, fast!"
end

task :clean_crew do
  puts "Jim, the soap! O.K. gentlemen, you both been to county before I’m sure. Here it comes!"
end

task :get_rid_of_evidence_at_monster_joes do
  puts "So what’s with the outfits? You guys are going to a Volleyball game or something?"
end

task :drive_into_the_sunrise do
  puts "Call me Winston!"
end

task :solve_bonnie_situation => [:get_mr_wolf, :calm_down_jimmy, :figure_out_bonnie_situation, :get_vince_vega_in_line, :clean_car, :clean_crew, :get_rid_of_evidence_at_monster_joes, :drive_into_the_sunrise]  do
  puts "You know, I’d go for breakfast. Feel like having breakfast with me?"
end

```

If you run the rake task that depends on the other we’ll get the following output:

###### Shell

``` bash

$ rake solve_bonnie_situation
You ain’t got no problem Jules, I’m on it! Go in there and chill them out and wait for the wolf who should be coming directly!
Jimmy, do me a favor, will you? I smelled some coffee back there. Would you make me a cup?
If I was informed correctly, the clock is ticking. Is that right Jimmy?
Come again? Get it straight buster. I’m not here to say please! I’m here to tell you what to do!
I need you two fellas to take those cleaning products and clean the inside of the car. I’m talking fast, fast, fast!
Jim, the soap! O.K. gentlemen, you both been to county before I’m sure. Here it comes! 
So what’s with the outfits? You guys are going to a Volleyball game or something?
Call me Winston!
You know, I’d go for breakfast. Feel like having breakfast with me?

```

The order in which you define your rake tasks has no effect on the output—only the order in which you place the prerequisite tasks in the array for task dependencies. Also, please use the hashrocket `=>` syntax for this.

A long list of dependenices might be a code smell. If you have to deal with something long, clean it up by encapsulting it inside a method which we then pass as prerequisite.

``` ruby

def mr_wolf_tasks 
  [:get_mr_wolf, :calm_down_jimmy, :figure_out_bonnie_situation, :get_vince_vega_in_line, :clean_car, :clean_crew, :get_rid_of_evidence_at_monster_joes, :drive_into_the_sunrise] 
end

...

task :solve_bonnie_situation => mr_wolf_tasks do
  puts 'You know, I’d go for breakfast. Feel like having breakfast with me?'
end

```

In the context of prerequsites, one thing to keep in mind though is that you only need to mention a namespace if you are outside the relevant one.

###### Some Rakefile

``` ruby

namespace :marsellus_wallace do
  task :call_winston_wolf do
    ...
  end
end

task :solve_bonnie_situation => 'marsellus_wallace:call_winston_wolf' do
  ...
end

namespace :marsellus_wallace do
  task :call_winston_wolf do
    ...
  end

  task :solve_bonnie_situation => :call_winston_wolf do
    ...
  end
end

```

Important to note though, in case you do need to mention the namespace, you have to pass the prerequsite as a string ```=> 'marsellus_wallace:call_winston_wolf'```.

Of course the examples above are goofy and not real life examples, but the intention was to show you how prerequisites work and how you’d put them together while they depend on each other.

## Tasks of Interest

Below is a short list of Rake tasks that come with Rails:

+ db
+ doc
+ tmp
+ stats
+ notes
+ about
+ secret
+ assets
+ routes

### db

Below are a couple of useful tasks under the `db` namespace for running Active Record migrations:

+ `rake db:version` prints the current version of the schema. The output looks something like this:

``` bash

Current version: 20160129135912

```

+ `rake  db:migrate` runs the last migration(s)—those which haven’t run yet. You can also pass it a specific migration to run.

###### Shell

``` bash

rake db:migrate VERSION=20080906120000

```

+ `rake db:create` creates your database. If defaults to the development and test databases.

``` bash

db/development.sqlite3
db/test.sqlite3

```

+ `rake db:test:prepare` makes sure that migrations that are already run on your development database are also run for your test database. If the test database’s schema would be out of sync with your development database, it would not be very useful of course.

+ `rake db:drop:all` drops both test and development databases by default.

+ `rake db:migrate:up`, `rake db:migrate:down` runs the `up` and `down` methods for the migration in question.

+ `rake db:redo` after you have run a migration, this ensures that the migration is reversible. It runs `rake db:down` first and then `rake db:up`.

+ `rake db:rollback` undos the last migration.

+ `rake db:drop` drops by the development and test databases by default.

+ `rake db:reset` drops the databases first and sets them up again by loading the schema and seeding the database.

### doc

+ `rake doc:app` generates documentation under `doc/app`. It creates HTML pages about your source code for easy browsing. Pretty cool!

###### Screenshot

{% img /images/Rake/rake-docs.png %}

+ `rake doc:rails` generates an API documentation under `doc/api`—also as HTML pages. Handy if you are offline I guess.

### tmp

The `tmp` directory in the root directory of your Rails app is the place for temporary files—most prominently files for sessions and cache.`rake tmp:create` sets you up with everything you need for dealing with temporary files. `rake tmp:cache:clear` clears the `tmp/cache` directory. `rake tmp:sessions:clear` clears the `tmp/sessions` directory.

### stats

`rake stats` gives you a nice overview of your app.

``` bash

+----------------------+-------+-------+---------+---------+-----+-------+
| Name                 | Lines |   LOC | Classes | Methods | M/C | LOC/M |
+----------------------+-------+-------+---------+---------+-----+-------+

| Helpers              |    13 |    13 |       0 |       1 |   0 |    11 |
| Models               |    89 |    54 |       6 |       7 |   1 |     5 |

+----------------------+-------+-------+---------+---------+-----+-------+
| Total                |   444 |   296 |      12 |      26 |   2 |     9 |
+----------------------+-------+-------+---------+---------+-----+-------+
  Code LOC: 136     Test LOC: 160     Code to Test Ratio: 1:1.2

```

### notes

You can leave notes in your code. You can prefix them in your comments with `TODO`, `FIXME`, `OPTIMIZE`.

###### Some Ruby file

``` ruby

# FIXME Something to fix here
class Agent < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :operation
  belongs_to :mission

...

```

When you run `rake notes`, Rake parses these prefixes and gets you a list of all these notes from your code. 

###### Shell

``` bash

app/models/agent.rb:
  * [1] [FIXME] Something to fix here

```

You even get a detailed list where you find them—directory, filename, line number `[Line Number]`, everything is included. Awesome, right?

### about

`rake about` gives you an overview of version numbers for 

+ Rails
+ Ruby
+ RubyGems
+ Database adapter
+ Schema version
+ Middleware
+ Application root

and lots of other useful information.

### secret

If you are paranoid about your session key and want to replace it, `rake secret` will generate a new pseudo-random key for you. It doesn not replace the key for you though. The output in the shell looks like this:

``` bash

b40a74b94cd93fed370fd4f8f9333633c03990b7d9128383511de5240acf3fa6b6b07127e875814fdadb32f1aa44d69c4e82592b0ce97f763ea216a21e61881d

```

### assets

`rake assets:precompile` let’s you precompile your assets under `public/assets`. If you want to get rid of older assets, just run `rake assets:clean`. Finally, running `rake assets:clobber` deletes the whole `public/assets` directory.

### routes

`rake routes` might be the most important one. It shows you all the routes in your app.

## Final Thoughts

Writing Rake tasks without knowing what’s going on under the hood gets boring pretty quickly. This article was a little warm up and introduction for people who wanted to peek into Rake for the first time. I hope it covered all the basics without being too dry—after all, Rake is super dope and all, but at the same time, it’s maybe not the sexiest of toys. This basic knowledge of Rake though should give you all you need to get dangerous and expand your knowledge of Rake tasks that are at your disposal.
