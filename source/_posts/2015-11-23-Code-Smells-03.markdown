### Heads Up

This article was mostly written for folks a little more new to coding. Having obviously walked in these shoes myself, I remembered that it felt unnecessary foggy to get into code smells and refactorings. On the one hand, authors expect a certain level of proficiency and therefore might not feel super compelled to provide the reader with the same amount of context as a newbie might need to comfortably dive into this world sooner. As a consequence maybe, newbies on the other hand form the impression that they should wait a bit longer until they are more advanced to learn about smells and refactorings. I do not agree with that approach and think that making this topic more approachable will help them design better software earlier in their career. At least I hope it helps to provide junior peeps with a solid head start.

### Topics

+ Case Statements
+ Polymorphism
+ Null Objects
+ Data Class

+ ### Case Statements

This one could also be named “checklist smell” or something. Case statements are a smell because they cause duplication—they are often inelegant as well. They can also lead to unnecessary big classes because all these methods that respond to the various (and potentially growing) case scenarios often end up in the same class—which then has all kinds of mixed responsibilities. Not a rare case that you have a lot of private methods that would be better off in classes of their own.

A big problem with case statements occurs if you wanna expand the case statements. Then you have to change that particular method—possibly again and again. And not only there, often they have twins repeated all over the place who now need an update as well. A great way to breed bugs for sure. As you might remember, we want to be open for extension but closed for modification. Here modification is inevitable and just a matter of time.


You make it harder for yourself to extract and reuse code, plus it is a ticking clutter bomb. Often view code depends on such a case statements—which then duplicate the smell and open the gate wide open for a round of shotgun surgery in the future. Ouch! Also, interrogating an object before you find the right method to execute is a nasty violation of the “[Tell-Don’t-Ask](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/TellDontAsk.html)” principle.

### Polymorphism
There is a good technique to handle the need for case statemens. Fancy word incoming! **Polymorphism**. This allows you to create the same interface for different objects and use whatever object needed for different scenarios. You can just swap in the appropriate object and it adapts to your needs because it has the same methods on it. Their behaviour underneath these methods is different but as long as the objects respond to the same interface Ruby does not care. For example, **VegetarianDish.new.order** and **VeganDish.new.order** behave differently but both respond to **#order** the same way. You just want to order and don’t answer tons of questions like if you eat eggs or not.

Polymorphism is implemented by extracting a class for the case statement branch and by moving that logic into a new method on that class. You continue to do that for every leg in the conditional tree and give them all the same method name. That way you encapsulate that behaviour to an object that is best suited to make that kind of decision and has no reason to further change. See, that way you can avoid all these nagging questions on an object—you just tell it what it’s supposed to do. When the need arises for more conditional cases, you just create another class that takes care of that single responsibility under the same method name.  

**Case Statement logic**

``` ruby

class Operation
  def price
    case @mission_tpe
      when :counter_intelligence
        @standard_fee + @counter_intelligence_fee
      when :terrorism
        @standard_fee + @terrorism_fee
      when :revenge
        @standard_fee + @revenge_fee
      when :extortion
        @standard_fee + @extortion_fee
    end
  end
end

counter_intel_op = Operation.new(mission_type: :counter_intelligence)
counter_intel_op.price

terror_op = Operation.new(mission_type: :terrorism)
terror_op.price

revenge_op = Operation.new(mission_type: :revenge)
revenge_op.price

extortion_op = Operation.new(mission_type: :extortion)
extortion_op.price
```

In our example we have an **Operation** class that needs to ask around about its **mission_type** before it can tell you its price. It’s easy to see that this **price** method just waits to change when a new kind of operation gets added. When you want to display that in your view as well, you will need to apply that change there also. (FYI, for views you can use polymorphic partials in Rails to avoid having these case statements blasted all over your view)

**Polymorphic Classes**

``` ruby

class CounterIntelligenceOperation
  def price 
    @standard_fee + @counter_intelligence_fee
  end
end

class TerrorismOperation
  def price 
    @standard_fee + @terrorism_fee
  end
end

class RevengeOperation
  def price
    @standard_fee + @revenge_fee
  end
end

class ExtoritionOperation
  def price
    @standard_fee + @extortion_fee
  end
end

counter_intel_op = CounterIntelligenceOperation.new
counter_intel_op.price

terror_op = CounterIntelligenceOperation.new
terror_op.price

revenge_op = CounterIntelligenceOperation.new
revenge_op.price

extortion_op = CounterIntelligenceOperation.new
extortion_op.price
```

So instead of going down that rabbit hole, we created a bunch of operation classes that have their own knowledge how much their fees add up to the final price. We can just tell them to give us their price. You don’t always have to get rid of the original (**Operation**) class—only when you find that you have extracted all the knowledge it had.

I think the logic behind case statements is unavoidable. Scenarious where you have to go through some sort of checklist before you find the object / behavior who gets to do the job is just too common. The question is simply how are they are handled best. I’m in favor of not repeating them and use the tools object oriented programming offers me for designing discrete classes that can be swapped out easily through their interface.

+ ### Null Objects

Checking for nil all over the place is a special kind of case statement smell. Asking an object about nil is often kinda a hidden case statement. Handling nil conditionally can take the form of **object.nil?**, **object.present?**, **object.try** and then some sort of action in the case **nil** shows up at your party. Another more sneaky question is to ask an object about its truthiness—ergo if it exists or if it’s nil—and then take some action. Looks harmelss but it’s just a disguise. Don’t be fooled, ternary operators or `||` operators also fall into this category of course. Put differently, conditionals not only show up clearly indentifiable as **unless**, **if-else** or **case** statments. They have more subtle ways to crash your party. Don’t ask objects for their nil-ness but tell them if the object for your happy path is absent that a null object is now in charge to respond to your messages.

Null objects are ordinary classes. There is nothing special about them—just a “fancy name”. You extract some conditional logic related to **nil** and then you deal with it polymorphically. You contain that behaviour, control the flow of your app via these classes and also have objects that are open for other extensions that suite them. Think about how a **Trial** (**NullSubscription**) class could grow over time. Not only is it more DRY and yadda-yadda-yadda, it’s also way more descriptive and stable. A big benefit of using null objects is that things can’t blow up as easily. These objects respond to the same messages as the objects emulated—you don’t always need to copy the whole API over to null objects of course—which gives your app little reason to go crazy. However, note that null objects encapusulate conditional logic without completely removing it. You just find a better home for it.



Since having a lot of nil related action in your app is pretty contagious and unhealthy for your app I like to think of null objects as the “Nil Containment Pattern” (Please don’t sue me!). Why contagious? Because if you pass **nil** around, some place else in your hierarchy, another method, is sooner or later also forced to ask if **nil** is in town—which then leads to another round of taking counter measures to deal with such a case. Put differently, nil is not cool to hang out with because asking for its presence becomes contagious. Asking objects for **nil** is most likely always a symptom of poor design—no offense and don’t feel bad!—we’ve all been there. I don’t wanna go “willy-nilly” about how unfriendly nil can be but a few things need to be mentioned:

+ Nil is a party pooper (sorry nil, had to be said).
+ Nil is not helpful because it lacks meaning.
+ Nil does not respond to anything and violates the idea of “[Duck Typing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_typing)”.
+ Nil error messages are often a pain to deal with.
+ Nil is gonna bite you—sooner or later.

Overall, the scenario that an object is missing something comes up very frequently. An often cited example is an app that has a registered **User** and a **NilUser**. But since users that don’t exist is a silly concept if that person is clearly browsing your app—it’s probably cooler to have a **Guest** that hasn’t signed up yet. A missing subscription could be a **Trial**, a zero charge could be a **Freebie** and so on. Naming your null objects is sometimes obvious and easy, sometimes super hard. But try to stay away from naming all null objects will a leading “Null” or “No”. You can do better! Providing a little bit of context goes a long way I think. Choose a name that is more specific and meaningful, something that mirrors the actual use case. That way you communicate more clearly to other team members and to your future self of course. 

There are a couple of ways to implement this technique. I’ll show you one that I think is straighforward and beginner-friendly. I hope it’s a good basis for understanding more involved approaches. When you repeatedly encounter some sort of conditional that deals with **nil** you know it’s time to simply create a new class and move that behaviour over. After that you let the original class know that this new player deals now with nothingness. 

In the example below you can see that the **Spectre** class asks a bit much about **nil** and clutters up the code unneccessarily. It wants to make sure that we have an **evil_operation** before it decides to charge. Can you see the violation of “Tell-Don’t-Ask”? Another problematic part is why would Spectre need to care about the implementation of a zero price. The **try** method also asks sneakily if the **evil_operation** has a **price** to handle nothingness via the **or** (**||**) statement. **evil_operation.present?** does make the same mistake. We can simplify this:

``` ruby

class Spectre
  include ActiveModel::Model
  attr_accessor :credit_card, :evil_operation

  def charge
    unless evil_operation.nil?
      evil_operation.charge(credit_card)
    end
  end

  def has_discount?
    evil_operation.present? && evil_operation.has_discount?
  end

  def price
    evil_operation.try(:price) || 0
  end
end

class EvilOperation
  include ActiveModel::Model
  attr_accessor :discount, :price

  def has_discount?
    discount  
  end

  def charge(credit_card)
    credit_card.charge(price)
  end
end

```

``` ruby

class NoOperation
  def charge(creditcard)
    "No evil operation registered"
  end

  def has_discount?
    false
  end

  def price
    0
  end
end

class Spectre
  include ActiveModel::Model
  attr_accessor :credit_card, :evil_operation

  def charge
    evil_operation.charge(credit_card)
  end

  def has_discount?
    evil_operation.has_discount?
  end

  def price
    evil_operation.price
  end

  private

  def evil_operation 
    @evil_operation || NoOperation.new
  end
end

class EvilOperation
  include ActiveModel::Model
  attr_accessor :discount, :price

  def has_discount?
    discount
  end

  def charge(credit_card)
    credit_card.charge(price)
  end
end

```

I guess this example is simple enough to see right away how elegant null objects can be. In our case, we have a **NoOperation** null class that knows how to deal with a non-existing evil operation via:

+ Handling charges of **0** amounts.
+ Knows that non-existing operations also have no discount.
+ Returns a little informative error string when the card is charged. 

We created this new class that deals with nothingness, an object that handles the absence of stuff, and swap it into the old class if **nil** shows up. The API is the key here because if it matches that of the original class you can swap in seamlessly the null object with the return values we need. That’s exactly what we did in the private method **Spectre#evil_operation**. If we have the **evil_operation** object we need we use that, if not, we use our **nil** chameleon that knows how to deal with these messages, **evil_operation** will never return nil anymore. Duck typing at its best. 

Our problematic conditional logic is now wrapped in one place and our null object is in charge of the behaviour **Spectre** is looking for. DRY! We kinda rebuilt the same interface from the orginal object that nil couldn’t handle . Remember, nil does a poor job at receiving messages—nobody home, always! From now on it’s just telling objects what to do without asking them first for their “permission”. What’s also cool is that there was no need to touch the **EvilOpertion** class at all.

Last but now least, I got rid of the check if an evil operation is present in **Spectre#has_discount?** No need to make sure that an operation exists in order to get the discount. As a result of the null object, the **Spectre** class is much slimmer and does not share other classes responsibilities as much. A good guideline to take away from this is to not check objects if they are inclined to do something. Command them like a drill sergant. As ever so often, probably not cool in real life but good advice for Object Oriented Programming. Now give me 20!

In general, all the benefits from using Polymorphism instead of case statements apply for Null Objects as well. After all it’s just a special case of case statements. The same goes for drawbacks:

+ Understanding the implementation and behaviour can become tricky because code is spread around and null objects are not super explicit about their existence.

+ Adding new behaviour might need to be kept in sync between null objects and their counterparts.

+ ### Data Class

Let’s close this article with something light. This is a smell because it’s a class that has no behaviour except getting and setting its data—it’s basically nothing more than a data container without extra methods that do something with that data. That makes them passive in nature because this data is kept there to be used by other classes. And we know already that this is not an ideal scenario because it screams *feature envy*. Generally speaking, we want to have classes that have state—meaning data they take care of—as well as behaviour via methods that can act on that data without much hindrance or snooping into other classes. 

You can start refactoring classes like these by possibly extracting the behavior from other classes that act on the data into your data class. By that you might slowly attract useful behaviour for that data and give it a proper home. It’s totally fine if these classes grow behaviour over time. Sometimes you can move a whole method over easily and sometimes you need / can extract parts of a bigger method first and then extract it into the data class. When in doubt, if you can reduce that access other classes have on your data class you should definitely go for it and move that behaviour over. Your goal should be to retire at some point the getters / setters that gave other objects access to that data. As a result you will have lower coupling between classes—which is always a win!

+ ### Closing Thoughts

See, wasn’t all that complicated! There is a lot of fancy lingo and complicated sounding techniques around code smells but hopefull you realized that smells and their refactorings also share a couple of traits that are limited in number. Code smells will never go away or become irrelevant—at least not until our bodies are enhanced by AIs who let us write the kind of quality code we’re light-years away from atm.

Over the course of the last three articles I presented you a good chunk of the most important / most common code smell scenarios you will ever so often bump into during your object oriented programming career. I feel like this was a good introduction for newbies to this topic and I hope the code examples were verbose enough to easily follow the thread. Once you have figured out these couple of principles for designing quality code you’ll pick up new smells and their refactorings in no time. If you have made it so far and feel you didn’t loose the big picture I think you’re ready to approach boss level OOP status.
