## Relationships

Visual design can help you to convey a message tailored to an audience. Design is communication! Via visual design you communicate with a viewer. Your “words” or your repertoire includes shapes, text, symbols, images, white space, textures, colors and movements(animations or implied movements. Good design work results in great communication by providing great solutions to visual problems. The principles are connected to each other, feed off each other and influence each other. You want to be a guide who takes a user through a design—where you want them to go (also where it’s best for them!). A good UI will take this concern seriously and offers appropriate solutions. Below you’ll find seven design principles and a hand full of useful gestalt principles you should be aware of. They should be taken as guidelines, not as being set in stone and help you make decisions that lead to more cohesiveness and quality. Keep in mind that good design solves problems—above all else.

Let’s also get something else out of the way real quick—it’s all about relationships. That’s basically it, end of story. Good visual design is the result of the successful creation of distinctive and cohesive relationships in your work. On an intellectual level, that’s easy to grasp. The hard part starts when you get frustrated trying to achieve elegance and quality by applying various design principles but a lack of practice of the craft is between you and your glorious ideas. Long story short, the following content is relatively easy to learn and understand but it takes repeated practice to put the pieces together and achieve results that creates these relationships successfully—while looking effortless at best.

While learning these visual design basics, I want to convey the idea that your number one priority should probably be to not frustrate or alienate your users while communicating via your designs. I currently think that visual design—especially on the web—should also build up confidence. The user needs to feel not only save, but also understand what you put in front of her—feeling dumb does not make users happy. They should never feel intimidated by the site or the content. You can apply all the visual design principles successfully, but if you fail at this, it will all be for nothing. Overall you want to be helpful, that should be your priority. These principles make you much more effective with that goal in mind. You want to not only create relationships within your design, more importantly, you want to create successful relationships with your users. Design can help with that.

## Gestalt Principles
“[Gestalt principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestalt_psychology)” are powerful tools for designers. They are psychological principals that visual design principles are heavily based on. We will cover them a bit along the way—where they fit in best. Similar to visual design principles, they can be applied to print, web, video and photography. The list below covers what we need to look into:

- Figure ground relationship
- Uniform Connectedness
- Law of Pragnanz
- Common Fate
- Continuation
- Similarity
- Proximity
- Closure

## Design Principles

The knowledge of these principles will help you make informed decisions about how to distribute pieces of your design in the overall composition. They will guide you in sizing objects and make it clearer how you should apply colors for example. Design principles are often very closely related and can’t stand too much on their own. When you put them to work, you should be able to achieve better visual hierarchy which in turn makes it easier for the user to navigate through your work. The relationships you create in your designs are only as good as the relationships people tend to look for—via psychological patterns. Design principles are most likely effective because they play to some kind of innate pattern recognition software that helped us form visual comforts and discomforts.

These principles help you achieve the best functionality that good design is capable of. Maybe it’s not a bad approximation to say that it helps with the communication of your product, content or whatever by being visually sound. The user should never be negatively surprised when you apply these principles. If you do your job right, the design becomes more invisible because you provide users little reason to stop and think. Effortless looking design can be one of your goals and it is easier achieved with these principles in your tool belt. Maybe effortless design and invisible design go hand in hand. Not sure, but they are definitely not too far apart from each other.

You want to remove the guesswork from our design process as much as possible and you can learn some of the necessary tools to do that. What we will learn is based on human psychology and will help you to make better, more informed decisions about how to compose your work. Understanding design principles will improve the quality of your work tremendously—and probably also speed up the time spent on particular pieces before they click. Experimentation is great, it really is, but guesswork can become tedious very quickly. Accepting that design principles are more or less part of the tool set, part of learning the craft, might not come easy—after all, most of us want to be unique, original and all. In my mind, there is no contradiction in that department though, but if you don’t pay attention to these, you won’t build a proper basis for breaking the rules gloriously. 

## Unity

Designs works best as a cohesive whole and should overall aim to achieve unity when you put all the elements together. Try to build up unified structures. Proximity, alignment, continuation and repetition can massively help to achieve perceived union among elements. This also helps you separate pieces of the puzzle without using additional borders or other design elements. It looks more classy that way as well I think. As viewers, we perceive the overall structure first when we look at new things. A unified whole meets the user half way with that expectation.

{% img /images/Design_101/Visual_Design/Unity/dropbox-team.png %}

###### Dropbox does a lot of things right and makes good use of every design principle in the book. The about page is a good example for unity. What I found most impressive though is how effortlessly they achieved visual unity with only a few elements on the page. I think they could even lose the borders and it would still work.

Unity needs to be built up over time—it doesn’t happen right away. I’d describe it as the combination of macro- and micro-unity in that regard. Smaller elements need to convey cohesion as well when you build up an overall unified impression. Doesn’t work without paying attention to smaller details first.

{% img /images/Design_101/Visual_Design/Unity/github-project-page.png %}

###### GitHub does a great job in establishing unity as well. All the little considerations in a content rich page like this add up to a consistent whole where all the pieces fit together and where nothing sticks out negatively. Impressive work really!

If you do your job right, it creates the sort of cohesion that makes viewers more comfortable. Establishing trust and understanding how users should follow the content is a free by-product. If nothing stands in the way that could block the users attention the more frictionless the user experience can take place. Don’t make users think, right? If nothing sticks out from the rest too much and if all pieces have some sort of relationship to each other, unity can be easier achieved.

{% img /images/Design_101/Visual_Design/Unity/github-integrations.png %}

###### This is another example of excellent use of this principle. The block that displays the list of integrations doesn’t need extra elements to establish unity. Since the unity of each list item is already strong in this section, they could also try to loose the borders.

## Alignment 

This design principle is the easiest to use to reduce visual clutter. Think of messy desk vs organized one. even if you like creative looking messy desks, your audience or customers might appreciate a well sorted appearance over a chaotic one. It’s also easier for them to navigate and find the relevant pieces of information if you can establish some sort of flow via alignment. As a side effect, hierarchy gets easier established without elements floating all over the place—or even lazily arranged ones. I guess it’s fair to say that missing alignment makes you look cheap or inexperienced—unless this is something you want to imply—or when you like to have an experimental, anarchistic vibe to a design I guess. Long story short, alignment is where it all begins and you are probably never wrong taking care of it properly.

{% img /images/Design_101/Visual_Design/Alignment-Continuation/dropbox-help.png %}

###### Grids are maybe the most obvious use of using alignment to your advantage. This screenshot from the Dropbox help center clearly shows how tidy proper alignment can look. Visually pleasing as well I think.

{% img /images/Design_101/Visual_Design/Alignment-Continuation/paravel-reynolds.png %}

###### [themanyfacesof.com](http://themanyfacesof.com/burt-reynolds/), a fun side project from [Paravel](http://paravelinc.com/), made a nice little Burt Reynolds themed site that has tons of examples where you can see good alignment in action. The alignment is very subtle and mostly achieved through great typography skills and grids—and breaking alignment skillfully every once in a while. 

{% img /images/Design_101/Visual_Design/Alignment-Continuation/dropbox-feature-list.png %}

###### The Dropbox feature list is another example that is worth studying. Simple, unpretentious and effective design work for structuring content using alignment to maximum effect.

## Continuation

Visual alignment is actually pretty much based on the Gestalt principle of continuation. We’ll look more into how you can use this in your work when we cover grids in this series. I should mention this though, objects that follow a common direction, for example by being aligned to each other, create the impression of being more related to each other than elements missing this guideline. Following these organized lines of content creates order in a layout. For example, letters that form words which in turn form sentences and paragraphs are a good example of how continuation creates a better sense of content. You can clearly see they are belonging to each other and how to follow them to digest the information.

{% img /images/Design_101/Visual_Design/Alignment-Continuation/color-drops.png %}

###### This is a great example of both alignment and continuation ([LOL Colors](http://www.lolcolors.com/)). Without using borders, you can clearly see a grid at work effectively and the form of the color drops implies movement continuing down the page. I love this piece!

On macro-level, you want to work on aligning things that are related to each other and position them along a common edge. That way, elements flow a lot easier in the overall composition and let users navigate effortless—if done right. This visual connection helps you form an overall unity between small and big elements. It’s like an invisible margin that holds the major pieces in your design together and gives the eye little reason to stop for visual hiccups. More often than not, edge alignment is more useful and applied more frequently than center alignment. Both have their place of course, but aligning content via edges is definitely your bread and butter when you design for the web. Center alignment for larger elements can be used to emphasize particular elements or call to actions.

## Emphasis

Emphasis is all about focal points. The less you have, the stronger their emphasis. You want to avoid making look everything important—that way nothing sticks out and all you end up with is noise. I’m sure you have seen sites that ignore that principle and plaster tons of funky colored buttons all over the place. Leaves a nasty taste, doesn’t it? That’s what a lack of emphasis can leave behind. More importantly, it does not help in creating a clear hierarchy. Your tools of choice are the usual suspects, but size and color might be the most effective at creating emphasis.

{% img /images/Design_101/Visual_Design/Emphasis/dropbox-signup-emphasis.png %}

###### Establishing a strong contrast with content or design elements around is another way to go. Although this site is a bit busy, Dropbox makes a great job at highlighting the action the user is supposed to make. Visually, there is nothing standing in the way that blocks the user from focusing on signing up. The strongest emphasis is on the blue buttons that clearly stand out from the rest in the viewport. This design has good visual balance too—even better if they’d go with only one blue button.

My approach these days is simple: one or two emphasized elements in a particular viewport should be enough to guide the user’s attention to the most important elements on the page. Deciding on which elements is maybe more difficult than it sounds like. You not only want to create interest among your users but also drive the attention where needed—fast and easily. Ask yourself, what is really so crucial to be grabbing the users focus first. Choose wisely and don’t annoy users with your decisions!

{% img /images/Design_101/Visual_Design/Figure-Ground/wooden-keyboard.png %}

###### The emphasis on the product is excellent in this design. Neither the description nor the background blocks the emphasis on the wooden [Orée](http://oreeartisans.com/products/oree-board) keyboard in any way. Beautiful! Symmetry is also working nicely here.

{% img /images/Design_101/Visual_Design/Figure-Ground/htc-vive.png %}

###### Not much to say about how HTC presented the [VIVE](http://www.htcvive.com/eu/product/). Emphasis at it’s best. Good design like this definitely sells.

{% img /images/Design_101/Visual_Design/Figure-Ground/craft-email.png %}

###### [Craft](http://www.invisionapp.com/craft) by Invision has made a nice landing page where they elegantly emphasized the input field for email addresses. Hard to get lost on this page. The name of the product sticks out nicely as well. The distinction between background and foreground is especially skilled and playful.

## Figure Ground Relationship

This principle is very powerful and I think so fundamental that you should master it as early as possible. Working on your designs, you should often ask yourself the simple question: what elements are basically background or foreground? 

{% img /images/Design_101/Visual_Design/Figure-Ground/raspberry-pi-figure-ground.png %}

###### You can see that the content and the button to take action clearly stick out from the background. (http://www.cayenne-mydevices.com/) A clear distinction is very important to play with the user’s focus effectively. Here the lines are a bit blurry and playful I’d say, but still a very clear figure-ground distinction.

When our early ancestors were hunting, gathering or whatever, it often was of vital importance to discern what might be an immediate threat or advantage—right in front of them. Distinguishing things quickly from stuff that are just background “noise” seems to still be part of our wiring for “survival”. Think of tiger behind a bush in the jungle vs rain on the horizon. Neurologically, this visual survival strategy has probably left such a deep imprint that we won’t change this simple mechanism of perception for quite a while. I know this sounds funny and mostly obsolete for digital folks, but knowing this, makes it simpler to decide how to accentuate important elements or information for users and how to “hide” less relevant stuff in the background. 

{% img /images/Design_101/Visual_Design/Figure-Ground/zappka.png %}

###### Here we have a very prominent background image that takes a lot of attention. Should convey some sort of emotional response I guess. Nevertheless, the button to take action is cleverly placed and its color is emphasized nicely into the foreground. (http://zappka.com/)

Another issue might be that our eyes and brains are not super fast at processing a lot of information at the same time which leads to prioritizing what we need to focus on first. This is no rocket science of course, but having this knowledge at the back of your head definitely helps placing pieces of the design puzzle more effectively.

{% img /images/Design_101/Visual_Design/Figure-Ground/startup-fucking-advice.png %}

###### This works quite ok, the distinction between background and foreground works somehow. I just don’t get why they didn’t place the red button at the end of the table—where the eye is drawn naturally due to the perspective of the image. Would have been much stronger emphasis without much effort. (http://www.startupfuckingadvice.com/)

Broken down to its core essence, figure ground relationship boils down to what can the user ignore at first and what she should focus on right away. For design with strong visual hierarchy, this is an essential Gestalt principle to produce quality work. Without applying this knowledge, you either stumble over a successful solution by accident or your outcome will be significantly weaker in establishing visual hierarchy. That all being said, skillfully blending the clear foreground / background distinction might result in nice results from time to time.

{% img /images/Design_101/Visual_Design/Figure-Ground/samsung-360.png %}

###### This one from the new Samsung [Gear 360](http://www.samsung.com/global/galaxy/gear-360/) is as good as it gets. The background and foreground work together extremely well. There is a clear distinction and the background accentuates the camera in the foreground elegantly. Pretty clever and playful too.

Below are couple more examples of good emphasis / figure-ground relationship for the road:

{% img /images/Design_101/Visual_Design/Figure-Ground/chewable-coffee.png %}

## Hierarchy

Hierarchy is all about visual importance and is sort of a cousin to emphasis in regards to reducing visual clutter. It’s mostly a macro guide on what to focus first and how to follow some sort of visual, subliminal breadcrumbs—like telling a visual story the user can cling on to when navigating your site. You can approach design elements like “layers of importance” that need to be arranged effectively. With only a few pieces strongly emphasized, you are taking the viewer softly by the hand and move him through the site as intended—more importantly, as you intend for the user to have the best possible experience.

{% img /images/Design_101/Visual_Design/Hierarchy/reddit-index.png %}

###### This screenshot of the Reddit index page is maybe not the best example of well crafted design—especially in the sense of establishing a clear and strong hierarchy. Reddit is one of these cases where the success of the site and design are not closely related I feel. It has an authentic ring to it, by being messy I mean, but I often wish their user experience would be enhanced by working more on their design. Wouldn’t need much to establish a better visual hierarchy.

As we covered before, you don’t want things to look equally important. That way your viewer would have a harder time to digest your content. Instead create various level of importance that emphasize the overall structure of your composition. One strategy that works pretty much always is: the bigger the size, the bigger the importance. These differences in size or whatever should be significant differences only, avoid going overboard. After you achieved a basic hierarchy through size and spacing, you can bring color to the mix. This can help emphasize certain elements even more. If you work the other way around, starting with color, you make your job unnecessarily harder—or at least less effective.

{% img /images/Design_101/Visual_Design/Hierarchy/github-trending.png %}

###### I like how the [Explore](https://github.com/trending) page at GitHub deals with typography to create a subtle and clear hierarchy. It’s very easy for the eye to follow the content downward. Color is also put to good use to create visual anchors. Same goes for their search results.

{% img /images/Design_101/Visual_Design/Hierarchy/github-search.png %}

###### Color, form, white space, size and alignment work together and create a solid hierarchy.
Good visual hierarchy is a bit like giving users directions without putting signs all over the place. It’s a lot more subtle and elegant that way. Skillfully implemented hierarchy let’s you avoid users feeling overwhelmed, especially when you have tons of content on a site. Users getting lost by a lack of hierarchy is the exact opposite you want to happen. Easy money you shouldn’t leave on the table. I sometimes wonder how many conversions are missed just because this important principle was ignored designing checkouts and stuff. A clear hierarchy distinguishes quickly between good and mediocre design solutions—also convey the skills and experience of the designer at work.

{% img /images/Design_101/Visual_Design/Hierarchy/what-is-dropbox.png %}

###### Another great example of how skillful designers at Dropbox execute their work. A lot more content to work with, but still successful at guiding the eye through the text. Subtle and skillful.

## Consistency

If you follow the principles discussed so far but lack consistency you not only confuse your viewer unnecessarily but also weaken the progress you achieved applying other design principles. Consistency helps to create a mental model of the design, site or look you are going for. Similar items should look similar—which in turn makes finding stuff easier. Also, once you get into coding your designs, making your designs more DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) is a lot more straightforward with that in mind.

{% img /images/Design_101/Visual_Design/Consistency/dropbox-plans.png %}

###### Another eye pleasing design from the Dropbox team. It shows consistency on various levels. The style and size of the illustrations are consistent—not only in this example but across the page actually. The buttons look the same—also page wide. The visual weight of all three columns are evenly distributed, aligned and share the same inner structure. Overall, simple, considered and effective.

Consistency sets expectations, the next thing should not look completely different—especially not to amuse the creative impulses of designers making their mark.

{% img /images/Design_101/Visual_Design/Similarity/startup-cards.png %}

##### [UX Timeline](http://uxtimeline.com/)

Not using a ton of different typefaces and font sizes is one of the most important applications of consistency. Users get used to read in a particular style or typeface and you don’t want to disturb that—at all! Lot’s of different typefaces is one nasty antipattern.

{% img /images/Design_101/Visual_Design/Consistency/type-consistency.png %}

##### [Whiplash](https://www.whiplashmerch.com/)

{% img /images/Design_101/Visual_Design/Similarity/soundcloud-charts.png %}

##### [SoundCloud Charts](https://soundcloud.com/charts/top)

Have you recently seen sites that use tons of different buttons instead of a few which would create much better consistency? I bet you have and that you didn’t like it. The buttons below belong to an interface inventory of one single site. As can be observed below, it’s amazing how far you can go in the wrong direction.

{% img /images/Design_101/Visual_Design/Consistency/atomic-design-buttons.png %}

###### A screenshot from Brad Frost’s excellent book about [Atomic Design](http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-4/)

The usability of a system can improve a ton when similar elements like these share the same look. Why make users learn a ton of visual language for navigating your page? It doesn’t make any sense! On the bright side, consistency helps you shape the design very subliminally without too many extra elements as distinguishers.

## Similarity

You guessed it, consistency has it’s roots in this Gestalt principle that says that similar looking things create a sort of unity that you can use in your designs. Elements that share similar characteristics appear to be more related to each other—more than dissimilar things. No surprises here of course. The being related part is the thing to focus on. Design elements can create a relationship just by looking similar. Elements that are similar, when put together can create strong contrasts to other elements around them which basically separates them without much effort or extra design barriers. That’s fantastic news because it can make our lives as designers a lot easier. This means that psychologically, it can help us create consistency by repeating particular elements. Avoid to create tons of variations of the same things, this only weakens your work—or most likely confuse users. Again, cohesion is the magic idea behind all this. 

{% img /images/Design_101/Visual_Design/Similarity/dribbble-peeps.png %}

###### The user list on [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/designers), displaying designers and their work, is a nice example how similarity can support a list of different design elements to create relationships and therefore appear more unified.

{% img /images/Design_101/Visual_Design/Similarity/reddit-bad-similarity.png %}

###### Reddit does not achieve great consistency by applying similarity that well. This list of posts has super long and super short titles, some headlines are indented while others aren’t. It looks a bit messy and wouldn’t take much work to create more cohesion via similarity.

You can achieve similarity by:

+ color
+ form
+ size
+ shape
+ texture
+ orientation
+ dimension
+ consistency of size 

All of them can suggest relationships when being similar. Color and shape are very strong examples to emphasize these relationships. I think that similarity of color is maybe the strongest. The eye is looking for color similarity very early in the process of discovering new stuff. If you can make it easy for it to find common threads via color, you make the user think less I guess. Although similarity is a mighty weapon to yield, it is nevertheless a tool for reinforcement of hierarchies, not one that easily creates it on its own.

{% img /images/Design_101/Visual_Design/Similarity/trending-open-source-boders.png %}

###### This list of trending Open Source repos on GitHub is really nice. Very simple, easy to read and digest as well as cohesive by being very similar. I think it is so successful in creating blocks of discrete content that it doesn’t even need these borders.

{% img /images/Design_101/Visual_Design/Similarity/trending-open-source-no-boders.png%}

###### After removing the borders, you can see that the similarity is still so strong that it doesn’t change the effectiveness of this list. The consistent use of similar elements can create a rather strong unity. See, I told you, it’s all about relationships really.

The subtle mental map we can create is not to be underestimated. It helps to establish a pattern for organizing content. Chaos is on the other end of that spectrum and is most likely not what we are aiming for. Imagine a page of text where the letters would not be displayed consistently on a line-by-line basis but would float randomly around the page. Not very inviting to read, huh?

{% img /images/Design_101/Visual_Design/Similarity/github-explore-weaker.png %}

##### This is the landing page of the [Explore](https://github.com/explore) section on GitHub. Here I think that a more consistent use of size and appearance would have been a bit more effective. At first I thought that the increased size was due to an “editorial” decision to consciously highlight certain categories. After a couple of refreshes it was clear thought that this was just randomized. Lacking good reason to play with size, the unity would have been stronger by sticking to consistency. Also, you have two sorts of cards, one with just a title for the category and one with additional descriptive text. On top of that, the hover effects are different for all three variations. Not a big issue overall, but imho not as strong as the showcases list of the same section below.

{% img /images/Design_101/Visual_Design/Similarity/github-explore-cards.png %}

###### Same content as above but the result is much stronger. Although the background colors are very different from each other, the cards look still very similar and consistent and the design is stronger as a result.

In terms of functionality, similar looking elements should accomplish similar tasks for the user. When users unnecessarily need to re-learn different behaviours for similar looking things, frustration might be the least of your problems—your credibility is kinda on the line as well. You definitely want to avoid creating too many question marks for users in that department. Similarity helps to manage expectations—that in itself is a very powerful tool in your arsenal. 

## White space

What exactly is considered white space? It’s unmarked, negative or empty space between elements in a composition. The macro white space is for the main pieces in your design—which create more obvious effects. Micro white space, on the other hand, are for minute details, like all the spacings for typographical elements. It’s great if you are after more subtle effects. A good grip on white space is considered elegant and timeless if executed right.

{% img /images/Design_101/Visual_Design/WhiteSpace/gear-360-white-space.png %}

###### Here the excellent use of white space creates a strong and elegant emphasis on this new product. There are a couple of principles put to work successfully, but white space is playing the strongest role to make this design work so well.

Sites with proper white space usually appear a bit lighter or more airy. In that regard, it also leads to a composition that is more digestable. Lesser whitespace can result in looking cheap—which can be a desired effect of course. I’m sure you have seen displays of luxury products and realized that they focus your attention by applying a ton of whitespace. It’s not so much about luxury vs cheap, but often, higher priced or valued products make good use of this principle. It’s another technique that you can use to lead a viewer from element to element.

{% img /images/Design_101/Visual_Design/WhiteSpace/foundersuite.png %}

###### ([Foundersuite](https://foundersuite.com/investor_crm)) When you investigate the sizes used to establish effective white space, you see that the measures used play off of each other. Let’s have a look below:

{% img /images/Design_101/Visual_Design/WhiteSpace/foundersuite-color-blocks.png %}

###### As you can see, this application of white space is active. Although not perfect in execution—web browsers duh—you can easily see how little consideration it takes to play with this design principle. Doesn’t take much work to go beyond your gut feeling.

To be most effective, white space must be active. It is a fuzzy description but it means that it should have relationships to elements around it. Active whitespace helps emphasize the composition or structure of your content and therefore affect the hierarchy positively. Passive whitespace is important as well since it can create small breathing rooms. But, too much inactive white space that is lacking relationships to surrounding elements and make your work look inconsiderate or even messy. It simply does not create the balance good design wants to achieve.

{% img /images/Design_101/Visual_Design/WhiteSpace/ionic-white-space.png %}

###### Another nice application of white space on [ionic.io](http://ionic.io/). There is a relationship in size as well as macro and micro white space playing nicely together.

When you read text, you see the useful application of white space every day without thinking much about it. The space between words, sentences and paragraphs is all white space and helps us to visually digest the meaning of the letters being written. It guides the eye through the content and gives us cues how the eye is most effectively moving through the text. Both macro and micro white space give the eyes a chance to rest and support the overall balance.

{% img /images/Design_101/Visual_Design/WhiteSpace/mighty-bell-white-space-blocks.png%}

Keep in mind that you want to achieve differentiation though space. This lets you cut back on other elements to create distinctions or borders. If you like that clean look of your favorite designs then the conscious application of white space was most likely one major component of it. Nothing speaks elegance and sophistication than proper user of white space.

## Balance

More often that not, you want all elements, or at least the most emphasized ones on a page to have optical equilibrium. Avoid having elements that look heavier than the rest! Balance is all about keeping visual weight in check. We like to look at things that are balanced around a vertical axis—a Rohrschach test image basically. Nothing wrong with that. This is a safe pattern to follow—very formal and ordered. If you can break that balance masterfully though, create a bit of a tension or surprise, maybe to highlight some part, your design might appear more dynamic and interesting.

{% img /images/Design_101/Visual_Design/Balance/blockhead-balance-01.png %}

###### The site for the [Blockhead](https://tenonedesign.com/blockhead.php) adapter has a few nice examples how they craftfully applied balance to their designs. Above, the image to the right and the text achieve a nice optical equilibrium. Same goes for the image below. Balance, hierarchy, whitespace and emphasis are all nicely applied.

{% img /images/Design_101/Visual_Design/Balance/blockhead-balance-02.png %}

Lucky for us, symmetrical balance is easy to achieve. Might be a tad more boring but it’s mostly a save bet. The asymmetric approach is less rigid or static but expects a bit more craft to pull off successfully. You need to work on keeping the various non-mirrored parts in a perceived balance. The elements involved are different from each other. It is not so much about getting a ruler out and measuring all the lengths, distances or white spaces, but about creating a visual, perceived equilibrium. Not easy to do but it can result in very beautiful and elegant solutions. Good examples show the experience of a well considered and crafted design.

{% img /images/Design_101/Visual_Design/Balance/dropbox-balance-01.png %}

###### It doesn’t get any better than that. The [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/) landing page makes excellent use of visual balance all over the place. You can see that the images and the text achieve a nice asymmetrical balance–especially in reference to other sections around them. An boy, don’t get me started on how they used the Koi carp to imply responsiveness and multi-device operability. Genius!

When you play with visual balance, all the design tools are at your disposal: size, color, position, shape, repetition, texture and so on can influence the perceived weight individually and play off of each other. Getting a good grip optical equilibrium is one of the harder skills to master I think.

Asymmetrical balance can be considered more friendly and conveys a design that appears more playful and dynamic. Not that I’m a Dropbox fan boy or something, but in terms of design they are making skillful use of every design principle in the book and achieve an overall quality that can be admired.

##### Dropbox’s about page. Pretty good balance, huh?

## Proximity

Design elements that are placed closer to each other seem to appear being more related. The distance between elements has an effect on their perceived relatedness. The closer they are arranged together, the closer the relationship is implied. You can enforce that mental proximity through color and similarity of course. Handling proximity right can affect your designs positively by enabling you to leave off other elements that would help you achieve a visual unity—borders for example. Again, unity is what this is all about. Proximity can be so strong though that it overshadows similarity of color or form.

###### On the site for [YoGrow](https://yogrow.co/ecommerce-stack) you can see how they made use of proximity. Maybe they could have used less of the background color and borders and let proximity do its magic. There is not too much to explain I think but proximity is one Gestalt principle that you want to not overlook. In the example below, proximity was all you need to imply the relationships of these color palettes. Borders or background colors can be left off and generates an elegant look ([LOL Colors](http://www.lolcolors.com/)).

## Closure

Closure is a technique where the user who watches a composition fills in the blanks of your designs—that you deliberately planted. It’s a form of suggestion I’d say, a sort of a illusion that completes the image that the designer wants you to see. Maybe you can also describe it as a design that leaves out all the stuff that is unnecessary to understand the image. For the human brain, it’s easier to see a pattern than to see disorganized pieces.

This technique let’s you create a possibly stronger visual imprint on the viewer I’d say. It’s like we dig a deliberate hole that is for the viewer to fill after they figure it out. This is sometimes the technique behind very clever logos. Have a look below.

The pattern-seeking human brain seems to operate by filling in missing pieces into familiar forms. It does not work well with things that are unfamiliar to us. Experience is necessary to invoke this mental trigger. Supposedly our minds are doing this on a vast scale with our everyday perception. It might even be a vital mechanism of how we construct our realities. Because we can’t fully sense what is going on around us, we cope by interpolating what’s out there—sort of I guess. This filling of the blanks let’s us focus on what’s important and probably go on with our business without being too much distracted by everything going on. Visual design learned to “exploit” that mechanism of our brain via closures. I’m not a psychologist, but this is the best description that I can come up with that summarizes all that I learned about this over time.

If that really leaves the viewer with a more ingrained impression or relationship to a brand or whatever, can be questioned of course. In general, you don’t want to make it too hard for viewers to fill in these blanks though. Very few people take the time to figure this stuff out, so they need to put it together quickly in order to be effective. If it’s taking them too long, you are wasting an opportunity to leave a positive impression—or worse any significant impression at all.

 Take GitHub for example. The logo they use on the page is a black circle—which attracts the eye just by its basic shape btw—and which has their Octocat as a closure inside. It works pefectly! Even at a small size, you can identify their mascot easily and placed in the navbar, it serves as a visual anchor that appears unpretentious and restrained. A closure can help with getting unnecessary details out of the way, form a stronger impression and create an elegant vibe that can appear timeless if done right.

So how does all of this tie into designing for the web? Well, it rarely does to be frank. It really is mostly useful for designing icons and logos which are of course an important part for designing on the web but don’t play a huge role in the overall composition. That being said, if applied successfully and if it fits the branding of the project, it can leave a sublime and memorable impression on the user. I decided to add this section because it is so fundamental to visual design that not mentioning it felt out of place. Closures won’t affect your day-to-day design work all that much though—except when you specialize in icons and logos of course.

## Final thoughts

Practice, practice, practice, there is no way around it! From now on, try to look for these principles when you take a look at other designs or art. Try to understand if the creators considered these principles and applied them actively or if they just followed their gut blindly, instinctively—which is not wrong by definition or anything but represents a limited tool set that is harder to rely on in your work. But most of all, have fun!
