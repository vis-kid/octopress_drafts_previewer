## Relationships

Let’s get this out of the way real quick—it’s all about relationships. That’s basically it, end of story. Good visual design is successful at creating distinctive and cohesive relationships. On a intellectual level, that’s easy to grasp. The hard part start when you get frustrated when you want to achieve elegance and quality by applying various design principles but the practice of the craft is between you and your glorious ideas. Long story short, the following content is relatively easy to learn and understand but it takes repeated practice to put the pieces together and achieve results that creates these relationships successfully—while effortless looking at best.

probably some kind of innate pattern recognition software that helped to form these visual comforts and discomforts

Learning these visual design basics, I want to convey the idea that your number one priority should probably be to not to frustrate or alienate users while communicating with your viewers via your designs. I currently think that visual design—especially on the web—should also build up confidence. The user needs to feel not only save, but also understand what you put in front of her. She should never feel intimidated by the site or the content. You can apply all the visual design principles successfully, but if you fail at the afore mentioned, it will be for nothing. Overall you want to be helpful, that should be your priority. These principles make you much more effective with that goal in mind. You want to not only create relationships within your design, more importantly, you want to create successful relationships with your users. Design can help with that.

## Design Principles

The knowledge of these principles will help you make informed decisions about how distribute pieces of your design in the overall composition, guide you in sizing objects and make it clearer how you should apply colors for example. Design principles are often very closely related to each other and can’t stand too much on their own. When you put them to work, you should be able to achieve better visual hierarchy which in turn makes it easier for the user to navigate through your work. The relationships you create in your designs are only as good as the relationships people tend to look for—via psychological patterns.

These principles help you achieve the functionality that good design is capable of. Maybe its not a bad approximation to say that it helps with the communication of your product, content or whatever by being visually sound and functional. The user should never be negatively surprised when you apply these principles. The design becomes more invisible because you provide users little reason to stop and think. Effortless looking design can be one of your goals and it is easier achieved with these principles in your tool belt. Maybe effortless design and invisible design go hand in hand. Not sure, but they are definitely not too far apart from each other.

Design principles want to help removing the guesswork from our design process as much as possible. They are based on human psychology and help you to make better, more informed decisions about how you compose your work. Understanding these will improve the quality of your work tremendously—and probably also speed up the time spent on particular pieces before they work. Experimentation is great, it really is, but guess work can become tedious very quickly. Accepting that design principles are more of less part of your tool set and part of learning the craft might not come easy—after all, most of us want to be unique and original. In my mind, there is no contradiction in that department though, but if you don’t pay attention to these, you won’t build a proper basis for breaking the rules gloriously. 

One last thing before we get to work: Design is communication! Via visual design you communicate with a viewer. Your “words” or your repertoire includes shapes, words, symbols, images, white space, textures, colors and movements(animations or implied movements like the continuation of a pattern or form). Good design work results in great communication by providing great solutions to visual problems. The principles are connected to each other, feed off each other and influence each other. You want to be a guide who takes a user through a design—where you want them to go(also where it’s best for them!). A good ui will take this concern seriously and offer appropriate solutions. It will most likely be be broken, should you you loose them or leave them behind. Below we’ll look into seven design principles and a hand full of useful gestalt principles you should be aware of. They should be taken as guidelines, not as being set in stone and help you make decisions that lead to more cohesiveness.

## Alignment 

edges line up, grid
align things that are reltated to each other
relationships of elements
align thigns that are realted to each other
reduces visual clutter, Think of messy desk vs organized one. even if you like creative looking messy desks, your audience or customers might appreciate a well sorted appearance over a chaotic one. It’s also easier for them to navigate and find the relevant pieces of content of information if you can establish some sort of flow via alignment. Hierarchy is also a piece of the puzzle that gets easier established without elements floating all over the place—or even lazy arranged ones. I guess it’s also fair to say that it makes you look cheap or inexperienced—unless this is something you want to imply, or when you like to have an anarchistic vibe to it I guess. Long story short, alignment is where it all begins and you are probably never wrong taking care of it.
The visual connection alignment creates helps you to form an overall unity between the elements in your overall composition

Think of an invisible margin that holds the major pieces in your design together, guided by an invisible hand. I think, more often than not, edge alignment is more useful and applied than center alignment. Both have their place of course, but aligning content via their edges is your bread and butter when you design for the web. Center alignment for larger elements can be used to emphasize particular elements or call to actions.
common edge
flow between elements

## Continuation (Gestalt Principle)

We’ll look more into this when we cover grids in the next article, but as a teaser I should mention this one as well. Objects that follow a common direction, for example by being aligned to each other, also create the impression of being more related to each other than elements missing this guideline. Following these organized lines creates order in a layout. Letters that form words which in turn form sentences and paragraphs are a good example of how continuation creates a better sense of content belonging to each other and how to follow it to disgest the information.

## Emphasis

focal point.
one item that has focal point creates useful emphasis
hierarchy
elements in hierarchy need to be easily distinguished, not too close to each other
size, color are good tools to create emphasis
creates interest
drives the attention, creates focus where needed
focal point
attention grabbing
usually one object
through size, color, space, texture, position
bringing attention to crucial elements the user should focus on or pay attention to first
You contrast elements against others
Something that should be perceived fast and easily. It should attract your attention easily
size, color, placement, form, white space.
Focus emphasis on few elements or nothing will stand out anymore

## Hierarchy

visual importance. Guide on what to focus first and then follow some sort of visual—subliminal—breadcrumbs. Like telling a visual story the user can cling on to.

?? Reddit screenshot ?? weak hierarchy. 

You don’t want to things to look equally important. That way your viewer would have a harder time to navigate your content.

You are creating various level of importance that they user can follow more easily. The bigger the size, the bigger the importance usually. After you achieved a basic hierarchy through size and spacing, you can bring color to the mix to emphasize certain elements even more. If you work the other way around, starting with color, you make your job unnecessarily harder—or at least less effective.

It’s a bit of giving users directions without putting signs all over the place. It’s more subtle than that, maybe more subcounciously if effectively applied

You want to avoid that the user feels overwhelmed, especially when you have tons of content on a site. In such a case, clear hierarchy is even more important and distinguishes quickly between good and mediocre design solutions

Users getting lost by lacking of hierarchy is the exact opposite you want to happen

You are taking the viewer softly by the hand and move him through the site as you intend and more importantly, as you intend for the user to have the best possible experience.


One should be strongly empasized
cousin to emphasis
layers of importance
reduces visual clutter
significant differences

## Consistency

mental model of the design or site
similar items should look simiilar
usability of a system improves when similar parts are displayed similarly
example: ton of different buttons from bRad frost bank
users dont have to learn tons of visual language for orienting on your page
sets expectations
next thing should not be totally different
not using tons of different typefaces is one important application of consistency.
user gets used to read in a particular style or typeface and you don’t want to disturb that
also, this helps shape the design very subliminally, where you can group content just by looking similar
finds stuff more quickly
antipattern: tons of differnt typefaces

## Similarity (Gestalt Principle)

Similar looing things create a sort of unity that you can use in your designs. They appear to be more related than disimilar things—no surprises here I guess. The related part is the thing to focus on. Design elements can create a relationship just by looking similar. That’s fantastic because it can make our lives as designers a lot easier. It also means that it can help us create consitency by repeating particular items and avoid creating tons of variations of the same things that might only confuse your users.

You can have similarity by
By 
color
form
size
shape
texture
orientation
dimension
consistency of size suggest relationships

color and shape are very strong examples to emphasize relationships 
We want to create a sort of subtle mental map that helps to establish a pattern for organizing content and for guiding the user experience. Chaos is most likely not what we are aiming for. Imagine a page of text where the letters would not be displayed consitently on a line-by-line basis but would float randomly around the page. That would not be easy to read huh? 

similarity of color is very strong to suggest relationship
The eye is looking for color similarity early in the process of looking at neww stuff

Similarity is also a way to create consistency in your composition. For example, you want to have buttons that accomplish similar things to look similar. You want to avoid to have links that look and behave differently for evey page because this lack of consitency creates confusion and stands in the way of ease of use.

?? lets have look at a site that does not give a damn about similarity.

?? Hard to navigate around here,no? Wouldn’t it be much easier to decide upon your next action if things wouldn’t look this dissimilar.

Similarity also provides sublte visual clues that train the user about the actions they take and what they can expect from similar looking things. You definitely want to avoid creating too many question marks for users in that department. Similar looking elements should accomplish similar tasks for the user. When users unnecessarily need to re-learn differnt behaviours for similar looking things, frustration might be the least of your problems. Similarity helps to manage expectations of your users—that in itself is a very powerful tool in your arsenal. 

?? example of good link, button design

?? contrasst with inconsistent designs

content relationships. defining the degrees of relatedness is a big part of successful designs I think. Cohesion is the magic idea behind this. Although similarity is a mighty weapon to yield, it is nevertheless a tool for reinforcement of hierarchies, not one that easily creates it on its own.

elements that are similar, when put together can create strong contrasts to other elements around them which basically separates them without much effort or extra design barriers.

Elements that share similar characteristics appear to be more related to each other.


## White space

unmarked, negative or empty space between elements in a composition
considered elegant and timeless if executed right
macro whitespace for main pieces in your design. more obvious effects
micro whitespace for minute details like spacing in text. more subtle effects
Whitespace often makes designs appear a bit lighter or more airy. In that regard also more digestable
luxury displays
lesser whitespace can appear more cheap. can be a desired effect of course
lead viewer from element to element, whitespace is considered more active
passive whitespace is important as well since it can create small breathing rooms
active whitespace helps emphasize the composition or structure of your content
strong emphasis through white space
creates focus and order if applied right
gives eye chance to rest
active and passive whitespace
balance and off balance
effects hierarchy
white space must be active. means that it should have relationships to elements around it
relationship to content
inactive white space does not create the balance good designs want to achieve with that design principle
White space, if active, can affect the hierarchy positively, inactive can make it look inconsiderate or even messy

If you like that clean look of your favorite designs then the conscious application of white space was most likely one major component of it. Nothing speaks elegance and sophistication than proper user of white space.

differentiation though space. lets you cut back on other elements to create distinction or borders

When you read text, you see white space every day. The space between words, sentences and paragraphs is all white space and helps us to visually digest the meaning of the letters being written. It guides the eye through the content and gives us cues who the eye is most effectively moving through it

?? Show Reddit page, that crams lots of stuff onto the page


## Balance

All elements, or most emphasised elements on page have optical equilibrium
elements dont look havier than  rest
symetrical is easy to achieve,but might be boring
symetrical and asymetrical balance
static, rigid -> symetrical
harder implement, more active and dynamic -> asymetrical

Balance is all about keeping visual weight in check. We often like to look at things that are balanced around a vertical axis—a Rohrschach test image basically. Nothing wrong with that. This is a safe pattern to follow—very formal and ordered. If you can break that balance masterfully though, create a bit of a tension or surprise, maybe to hightlight some part, your design might appear more dynamic and interesting though.

When you play with visual weight, you always deal with asymmetry in a way. You need to work on keeping the various non-mirrored images in a perceived balance. The elements involved are different from each other. It is not so much about getting a ruler out and measuring all the lengths and distances or whitespaces, but about creating a visual, perceived equilibrium. Not easy to do but it can result in very beautiful and elegant solutions. It shows the experience of a well considered and crafted design.

All the design factors you have at your disposal, size, color, position, shape, quantity, texture and so on can influence the perceived weight individually and playing off of each other.

This balance is more friendly, less static or rigid and conveys a design that appears more playful and dynamic.

## Unity

Designs should overall aim to achieve unity when you put all the elements together but also between elements that build up the structure. Maybe it would not be crazy to call it macro- and micro-unity in that regard. This implies the sort of cohesion that makes viewers more comfortable and trusting as well as understanding how they should follow the content. My impression is that the more unified a design becomes the more invisible it gets. If nothing stands in the way that could block the users attention to elements that question the overall unity, the more frictionless the user experience can take place. Don’t make users think, right?

Proximity, alignment, continuation and repetition can massively help to achieve perceived union among design elements. This also helps you separate pieces of the puzzle without using additional borders.

It looks more classy that way as well I think.

We want to perceive the overall structure first when we look at new things. A unified whole makes this process a lot more smooth.

## Figure Ground Relationship

This principle is very powerful and I think so fundamental that you should learn about it as early as possible.

Working on your design, you should often ask yourself the simple question what consitutes elements that are bascially background or foreground. When our early ancestors were hunting, gathering or whatever, it often was of vital importance to discern what might be an immediate threat or advantage right in front of them and distinguish quickly from stuff that is just background “noise”. Think of tiger behind a bush in the jungle vs rain on the horizon. Neurologically, this visual survival strategy has probably left such a deep imprint that we won’t change this simple mechanism of perception for quite a while. Knowing this though, makes it much simpler to decide how to accentuate important elements or information for users and how to “hide” less relevant stuff in the background. Another issue might be that our eyes and brains are not super fast at processing a lot of information at the same time which leads to prioritizing what we need to focus on first. This is no rocket science of course but having this knowledge at the back of your head definitely helps placing pieces of the puzzle more effectively. Broken down to its core essence, figure ground relationship boils down to what can the user ignore at first and what should she focus on right away. For design with strong visual hierarchy, this is an essential design principle to produce quality work. Without applying this knowledge, you either stumble over a successful solution or your outcome will be significantly weaker in creating visual hierarchy.

?? Blending them sometimes and breaking the clear distinction might result in nice results. ??

## Proximity

Design elements that are closer to each other seem to appear to be more related to each other. You can enforce that mental proximity through color and similarity of course. Handling proximity right can affect your designs positively by enabling you to leave off other elements that woule help you achieve a visual unity. Unity is what this is all about. Proxmity can be so strong that it overshadows similarity of color or form.

The distance between elements has an effect on their perceived relatedness. The closer they are arranged together, the closer the relationship is implied.

## Closure

Closure is a technique where the user who watches your composition fills in the blanks of your designs—that you deliberately planted—and thereby create a possibly stronger visual imprint on the viewer I’d say. It’s like we dig a deliberate hole that is for the viewer to fill after they figure it out. This is sometimes the techniques behind very clever logos. If that really leaves the viewer with a more ingrained relationship to a brand or whatever can be questioned of course.

?? Examples of logos

WWF logo
Vase

You don’t want to make it too hard for viewers to fill in these blanks though. Very few people take the time to figure stuff out they can’t put together quickly. If it’s taking them too long, you are wasting an opportunity to leave a positive impression—or worse any significant impression at all. Easier to see a pattern than to see disorganized pieces.

It’s sort of a illusion that completes the image that the designer wants you to see.
Maybe you can also describe it as a form to leave out all the stuff that is unnecessary to understand the image.o

The pattern seeking human brain seems to seek filling in missing pieces to familiar forms. It does not work well with things that are unfamiliar to use. Experience is necessary to invoke this mental trigger. Supposedly our minds are doing this on a vast scale with our everyday perception. Because we can’t fully sense what is going on around us, we cope by sort of interpolating what’s there. This filling of the blanks let’s us focus on what’s important and probably go on with our business without being too much distracted by everything around us. Visual design learned that mechanism of our brain and tries to “exploit” it via closures. I’m not a psychologist, but this is the best description that I can come up with to summarize all that I learned about this over time.

It might even be a vital mechanism how we construct our realities.

It is a form of suggestion I’d say. 

## Final thoughts

practice, practice, practice
try to look for these principles when you take a look at other designs or art and try to understand if the creator considered these principles and worked with them or if somebody just followed their gut blindly or instinctively—which is not wrong by definition or anything but represents a limited tool set that is harder to rely on
