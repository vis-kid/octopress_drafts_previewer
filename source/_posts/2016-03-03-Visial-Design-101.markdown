## Topics

+ Relationships

probably some kind of innate pattern recognition software that helped to form these visual comforts and discomforts

We want to remove the guesswork from our design process as much as possible. Visual design principles are based on human psychology and help you to make better, more informed decisions about your work. Understanding these will improve the quality of your work immennsely and will probably also speed up your time spent on a particular composition. They are more of less part of your toolset and part of learning the craft. Pay attention to these, you won’t build a proper basis not knowing how to apply these principles in your work.

This knowledge will help you make informed decisions about how distribute pieces of your design in the overall composition, guide you in sizing objects and make it clearer how you should apply colors. Design principles are often very closely related to each other and can’t stand too much on their own. When you put them to work, you should be able to achieve better visual hierarchy that makes it easy for the user to navigate through your work. The relationships you create in your designs are only as good as the relationships people tend to look for—psychologically I mean. That’s basically what design principles are for.




Design is communication
guide user through content, ui, where you want them to go

visual design principles
seven principles
all connected
guidelines
cohesive

## Alignment 

edges line up, grid
relationships of elements
align thigns that are realted to each other
reduces visual clutter
common edge

## Emphasis
creates interest
drives the attention, creates focus where needed
focal point
attention grabbing
usually one object
through size, color, space, texture, position

## Hierarchy
One should be strongly empasized
cousin to emphasis
layers of importance
reduces visual clutter
significant differences

## Consistency
usability of a system improves when similar parts are displayed similarly
example: ton of different buttons from bRad frost bank
users dont have to learn tons of visual language for orienting on your page
sets expectations
finds stuff more quickly
antipattern: tons of differnt typefaces

## White space
unmarked space between elements in a composition
considered elegant and timeless if executed right
luxury displays
strong emphasis through white space
gives eye chance to rest
active and passive whitespace
balance and off balance
effects hierarchy

## Balance
All elements on page have optical equilibrium
elements dont look havier than  rest
symetrical and asymetrical balance
static, rigid -> symetrical
harder implement, more active and dynamic -> asymetrical

## Unity
Design works cohesively as a whole
nnothing sticks out from the rest
all pieces have relationships

## Figure Ground Relationship

This principle is very powerful and I think so fundamental that you should learn about it as early as possible.

Working on your design, you should often ask yourself the simple question what consitutes elements that are bascially background or foreground. When our early ancestors were hunting, gathering or whatever, it often was of vital importance to discern what might be an immediate threat or advantage right in front of them and distinguish quickly from stuff that is just background “noise”. Think of tiger behind a bush in the jungle vs rain on the horizon. Neurologically, this visual survival strategy has probably left such a deep imprint that we won’t change this simple mechanism of perception for quite a while. Knowing this though, makes it much simpler to decide how to accentuate important elements or information for users and how to “hide” less relevant stuff in the background. Another issue might be that our eyes and brains are not super fast at processing a lot of information at the same time which leads to prioritizing what we need to focus on first. This is no rocket science of course but having this knowledge at the back of your head definitely helps placing pieces of the puzzle more effectively. Broken down to its core essence, figure ground relationship boils down to what can the user ignore at first and what should she focus on right away. For design with strong visual hierarchy, this is an essential design principle to produce quality work. Without applying this knowledge, you either stumble over a successful solution or your outcome will be significantly weaker in creating visual hierarchy.

?? Blending them sometimes and breaking the clear distinction might result in nice results. ??

## Similarity


Similar looing things create a sort of unity that you can use in your designs. They appear to be more related than disimilar things—no surprises here I guess. The related part is the thing to focus on. Design elements can create a relationship just by looking similar. That’s fantastic because it can make our lives as designers a lot easier. It also means that it can help us create consitency by repeating particular items and avoid creating tons of variations of the same things that might only confuse your users.

You can have similarity by
By 
color
form
size
shape
texture
orientation
dimension
consistency of size suggest relationships

color and shape are very strong examples to emphasize relationships 
We want to create a sort of subtle mental map that helps to establish a pattern for organizing content and for guiding the user experience. Chaos is most likely not what we are aiming for. Imagine a page of text where the letters would not be displayed consitently on a line-by-line basis but would float randomly around the page. That would not be easy to read huh? 

similarity of color is very strong to suggest relationship
The eye is looking for color similarity early in the process of looking at neww stuff

Similarity is also a way to create consistency in your composition. For example, you want to have buttons that accomplish similar things to look similar. You want to avoid to have links that look and behave differently for evey page because this lack of consitency creates confusion and stands in the way of ease of use.

?? lets have look at a site that does not give a damn about similarity.

?? Hard to navigate around here,no? Wouldn’t it be much easier to decide upon your next action if things wouldn’t look this dissimilar.

Similarity also provides sublte visual clues that train the user about the actions they take and what they can expect from similar looking things. You definitely want to avoid creating too many question marks for users in that department. Similar looking elements should accomplish similar tasks for the user. When users unnecessarily need to re-learn differnt behaviours for similar looking things, frustration might be the least of your problems. Similarity helps to manage expectations of your users—that in itself is a very powerful tool in your arsenal.

content relationships. defining the degrees of relatedness is a big part of successful designs I think. Cohesion is the magic idea behind this. Although similarity is a mighty weapon to yield, it is nevertheless a tool for reinforcement of hierarchies, not one that easily creates it on its own.

elements that are similar, when put together can create strong contrasts to other elements around them which basically separates them without much effort or extra design barriers.

## Proximity

Design elements that are closer to each other seem to appear to be more related to each other. You can enforce that mental proximity through color and similarity of course. Handling proximity right can affect your designs positively by enabling you to leave off other elements that woule help you achieve a visual unity. Unity is what this is all about. Proxmity can be so strong that it overshadows similarity of color or form.

## Continuation

We’ll look more into this when we cover grids in the next article, but as a teaser I should mention this one as well. Objects that follow a common direction, for example by being aligned to each other, also create the impression of being more related to each other than elements missing this guideline. Following these organized lines creates order in a layout. Letters that form words which in turn form sentences and paragraphs are a good example of how continuation creates a better sense of content belonging to each other and how to follow it to disgest the information.

## Closure

Closure is a technique where the user who watches your composition fills in the blanks of your designs—that you deliberately planted—and thereby create a possibly stronger visual imprint on the viewer I’d say. It’s like we dig a deliberate hole that is for the viewer to fill after they figure it out. This is sometimes the techniques behind very clever logos. If that really leaves the viewer with a more ingrained relationship to a brand or whatever can be questioned of course.

?? Examples of logos

WWF logo
Vase

You don’t want to make it too hard for viewers to fill in these blanks though. Very few people take the time to figure stuff out they can’t put together quickly. If it’s taking them too long, you are wasting an opportunity to leave a positive impression—or worse any significant impression at all. Easier to see a pattern than to see disorganized pieces.

It’s sort of a illusion that completes the image that the designer wants you to see.
Maybe you can also describe it as a form to leave out all the stuff that is unnecessary to understand the image.o

The pattern seeking human brain seems to seek filling in missing pieces to familiar forms. It does not work well with things that are unfamiliar to use. Experience is necessary to invoke this mental trigger. Supposedly our minds are doing this on a vast scale with our everyday perception. Because we can’t fully sense what is going on around us, we cope by sort of interpolating what’s there. This filling of the blanks let’s us focus on what’s important and probably go on with our business without being too much distracted by everything around us. Visual design learned that mechanism of our brain and tries to “exploit” it via closures. I’m not a psychologist, but this is the best description that I can come up with to summarize all that I learned about this over time.

It might even be a vital mechanism how we construct our realities.

It is a form of suggestion I’d say.
