95 % web design is 95 percent


when you take away all of the typo of most websites, they basically implode. There is no web design without type. So why not get good at it and improve your web design skills by applying typogrography skills which have been handed down to use by the type world and graphic designers.

At first, web design tried to follow a lot of the ideas of graphic design, especially how books, magazines and newspapers were layed out and designed. These days, the design for the web has matured a lot and does not follow these ideas as close as they used to. Designers adjusted the their designs to the needs of the new medium but also realized that they can go further in some areas because we are talking about a digital medium that has different options. Responsive design is one example where design clearly matured over the print world in many, many ways. The flip side is, that this has also led to more complexity—which also seems to be ever increasing. To me, this does not sound threatening. Quite on the contrary, I feel this is very exciting and the possibilities are not only growing but the options today are vast and cool already. The web has grown up obviously—quite a bit—and the future seems bright!

Type helps you better than anything else to convey your message. Sure, graphics can support and enhance that, icons too, but communicating with users on the web happens mostly via the written word—in contrast to the advertising world, where images and graphics can convery whole stories a lot easier, even without using much written language at all. But on the web, we are talking about pages, sites and most of all interfaces. Dealing with mostly graphical elements for these media turned out to be difficult, often ineffective, ambiguous and not fit for the mass market.

I’m sure we all have seen pages which are more on the experiemntal side, which heavily use graphical language—excluding type—to accomplish some design goal but imagine a project like Facebook, Twitter or even Google going in that direction. I think it’s pretty much a sure bet that this would be a disaster—a huge one. So, type is king on the web. Like it or hate it, but ignoring it, is not an option.

## Typefaces & Fonts

### Typefaces

Typefaces are collections of letters, numbers and punctuations that form a set for an alphabet. It’s sort of a family of type that share common design choices but can vary in weight and styles. Bodoni would be a typeface. 


{% img /images/Typography-101/A_Specimen_by_William_Caslon.jpg %}

### Fonts

This is somewhat of a subset of a typeface. It’s a character set of a particular typeface in one particular size. Bodoni bold 9 point would be a font. The other use of the word font applies to font files which render the typefaces at various sizes.

Typefaces are usually made up of multiple fonts.

## Typographic Anatomy

We will go over some of the most important anatomic features of type. The stuff that is really good to know and useful if you have conversations about it. But I feel like I should mention that you don’t need to deep dive on all of these just to become dangerous at type. It’s good to know, for sure, but there are more important things to memorize I think. Obviously, obsessive type nerds might find it funny if you are unaware of terminals and stuff, but honestly who gives a damn—much bigger fish to fry and it’s not always about the technical details. It’s what you do, what you achieve when you put typefaces at “work”. So my advice is simple, understand and memorize the basics, have fun, play around with the typefaces and soak it in over time. There is nothing wrong with not knowing every single detail about type anatomy!

### Baseline

{% img /images/Typography-101/baseline-01.png %}

The baseline is where most of the letters are placed upon.

### Median

{% img /images/Typography-101/median.png %}

The median on the other hand is the line where most lowercase letters end.

### X-Height

{% img /images/Typography-101/x-height.png %}

The space between the baseline and the median is what we call x-height. Most of the time it represents the height of the lowercase letter of an “x”—therefore its name. The more x-height a font offers, the more readable it will end up usually. Why? Because most of the text we read in the western world is comprised of lowercase letters. A lot of the small distinctions that help us identify individual letters and quickly build them up to words to convey meaning are comprised in this little x-height zone. That also means that this extra space gives a font a bit more opportunity to let its character shine through.

I guess it makes sense that if you have a small x-height, the eyes has less detail or less information to quickly make sense of letters and put them in context. Sure you can always read letter by letter and piece the info together like that, but most of us tend to read in jumps and consume letters a lot more subconsciously.So more x-height is good for body copy because long paraphraphs of text can get tiresome if the eyes have to work a lot to decypher the alphabet. Sections like titles where you will generally user bigger font sizes and shorter amounts of text anyway, can get away with less than optial x-heights. In that case you can make use of more artistic choices that convery maybe a certain mood or character without affecting the reading experience of your users too badly.

### Ascender

{% img /images/Typography-101/Typographic_ascenders.png %}

The ascender is that part that stretches above the median.

### Descender

{% img /images/Typography-101/Typographic_descenders.png %}

This part of a letter extends below the baseline.

### Counter

{% img /images/Typography-101/counters.png %}

Counters are areas that are partially or fully enclosed. Think of an “o” or an “a”. The “a” for example has two counters—one that is partically and one that is fully enclosed. Typefaces with larger counters are usually also good for readability because the details have more room to be explicitly shown. So look for typefaces with large x-heights or larger counters if you are interested in giving users a good reading experience.

### Line Height

{% img /images/Typography-101/line-height.png %}

This is the space between two consequent baselines. In print, this is very important to create a consistent vertical rhythm, the baseline grid. This is somewhat of a mini grid system for type on a page. On the web, the line-height that browsers render does not play ball and does not allow us to easily achieve this kind of typographical grid system. The vertical rhythm would be nice because you can place every piece of type on a consistent grid that goes down the page. The overall effect is very pleasing and we are probably all used to it from reading books.

A good line height on the web for paragraphs of text usually lies between 1.3–1.6em. Titles can and should be a bit tighter. This is a good starting point to achieve rather nice readability. Trust your gut and try out various line heights until you achieve a visually pleasing result. This is not so much about precise math. For shorter paragraphs that don’t span as much over a page, you can apply lesser line height than for longer spanning paragraphs. But again, every typeface needs its own height to breath appropriately. A good benchmark to keep in mind is that you want to be able to jump to the start of the next line rather easily. You don’t want users to burden with some sort of mental overhead by needing to look hard where they should continue when they reach the end of a line of text.

In the end, typefaces can be very different from each other and need individual tweaks that can’t be determined by generalized numbers. Varying degrees of line height affect the color of your text. That means that tighter line heights look darker since the micro white space between lines of text gets reduced—and vice versa of course. Finding that balance of text that looks coherent, light and readable is your goal while adjusting this measure. You definitely want to avoid having too tight line height where the text becomes visually darker and the lines can seem to almost crash into each other. Lines of body copy that seem to float apart and create an incoherent sea of text is the other extreme to avoid. Read the text, use real text not dummy ipsum and see how it feels. Is it a good reading experience? This should be on top of your mind—always!

On the web, this tends out to be a tiresome practice to achieve and not worth pursuing all that much—unless you are going for some typographical project that imitates print or something. Also, considering responsive environments makes applying baseline grids even less appealing. In the end it most likely is not worth the bang for the buck and can only achieved with significant efforts. The future might provide more effective and more convenient solutions for course. Let’s see! If you wanna do the math and have a good reason to create a baseline grid on the web then go for it. Otherwise, your time might be better invested in more pragmatic matters.

### Line Length / Measure

{% img /images/Typography-101/measure.png %}

Both mean the same thing. It consists of the number of characters on a single line of text. A good measure on for designs on the web lie between 60–85 characters. Line length and line height are somewhat symbiotic and depend on each other. The more line length a paragraph needs, the more line height should be incorporated. The same advice about your instincts applies here as well. If it looks too cramped or too stretchy, adjust it until it readable and “feels” right. Obviously you will need experience to achieve good results when you follow your gut a bit—but math is only getting you so far.

### Kerning

{% img /images/Typography-101/Kerning2.png %}

Kerning is referred to as the varying micro white space between individual letters. This is differently adjusted by the type designer, complying with the needs of each letter. A lowercase “o” might occupy lesser space and a lowercase “t’ for example. On the web this is tedious to adjust while the practice of kerning is very prevalent in the print industry. On the web, this involves unreasonable amounts of JavaScript or span wrappers that are not really scalable. For titles and logotypes you can go that route and you sometimes even need to do that. Lots of typefaces that are designed for smaller sizes tend to need a bit of extra kerning when you display them at bigger font sizes. On the other hand, there are also typefaces that are designed for exactly that scenario and have the appropriate kerning already baked in. Display fonts??

### Letter Spacing / Tracking

{% img /images/Typography-101/Letter-spacing.png 600 %}

Refers to the consistent spacing between all of the letters in a group. It does not target individual letters like kerning does, but it’s rather a uniform adjustment that spans across the entire affected text passage. If results in more or less density and texture. When you use larger pieces of text for title for example, a little bit of negative letter spacing can go a long way. You don’t want to create the impression that the text is drifting apart. As with kerning, when typefaces are designed to be consumed at smaller font sizes, the letter spacing might need these little nudges since the original kerning was considered differently. 

## Typographic Classifications

The classification for typefaces is vaster—especially the subclassifications—than one might think at first. On the other hand, the essentials to start out are quick to get a grip on. Let’s look at a few that you absolutely need to know, especially when your work includes mostly designing web stuff. I should also mention that I won’t won’t bombard you with a wide array of typefaces that you should look into first. My goal is to teach you what you need to know to fish—not to feed you in for that matter. I want you to understand the basics and lingo first before you go out in the wild, hunting for typefaces.

### Serif Typefaces

Serifs are called the little extensions, decorative details, at the end of some strokes of letters.

{% img /images/Typography-101/Serifs.png %}

Serif typefaces are the oldest we will discuss in this article. It’s not an exact science but arguments can be made that they go back as early as Romans carving letters into stones, using the Latin alphabet. There is also one interesting theory that says that they are a result of using chisels when carving stones and were an artistic choice due to the tools used to create a better end result. 

###### Screenshot

Serifs are considered easier to read and are therefore often used for longer pieces of text like body copy. The evidence on that seems a bit inconclusive though. Nevertheless, this argument often comes up.



###### Screenshot

###### The headers the Washington Post uses are a nice example of using a serif to convey a certain style of tradition and quality while the sans-serif body copy makes it look modern while being highly readable.


They were conceived to look like hand-written text. ?? Venice / Italics??
The look more old school and classic but you can also make them look very modern. Depending on the context you apply Serif text.


### Sans Serif Typefaces

These typefaces lack the serif 

{% img /images/Typography-101/sans-serif.png %}

###### Screenshot

{% img /images/Typography-101/screenshots/sans-serif-soil.png %}

Sans-Serifs started to get popular in the 1920s and got rid of all the extra Serif parts. They were designed to look modern, industrial and machine-made. They were ideal for the advertisement industry. Since you can place more text in the same space—Serif extensions take up more space of course—they were considered more economical as well.

### Semi Serif Typefaces

They incorporate both characteristics of serif and sans serif typefaces.

### Slab Serif Typefaces

{% img /images/Typography-101/slab-serif-rockwell.png 500 %}

Slab serifs are similar to serifs but are much thicker and more attention-grabbing in nature. In the past, they were often used for typewriters to make sure they create enough contrast on the page. Typewriters had a harder time getting consistent type on a page—depending on the pressure and the freshness of the ink and such—that a slimmer serif would have been less effective for that. The early advertising industry also needed something new and attention-grabbing and made heavy use of slabs.

### Script Typefaces

{% img /images/Typography-101/Cursive.svg.png 600 %}

These typefaces emulate the look of hand-written text. The varying thickness and fluidity should be imitated with it.  Their look is more casual and informal and can often give the feel of something hand-crafted and personal.

### Monospace Typefaces

As the name suggests, each letter and punctuation occupies the same horizontal width. The other typefaces we covered so far all have variable widths within their letters—also called proportional. Typewriters, early computers and terminals were heavily using this kind of type. The hardware did not accomodate the needs for variable widths of other type families. The graphical limitations were enormous in these days. Todays text editors for writing code still offer monospaced fonts by default. Maybe, nothing says hacker more clearly than written in monospace.

## Punctuations

### Quotes

Use real quotes. Period! The other “quotes” most people are carelessly using are straight quotes—which are actually used for inches and feet—and are also called “dumb quotes”. You don’t wanna use that, don’t you? Apostrophes and single quotes also have their real counterpart. Yes, you need to do some finger kung-fu on your keyboard to get them, but you are making yourself look bad and inexperienced if you ignore them.

### Ellipsis

Ellipsis refers to the three dots that can easily be mistaken as three single periods. The difference is that they have more spacing between each period. ?? use for??

If you use extra space to the left and right is up to you to decide. There is no standard for it at the moment.

You use it when you want to omit stuff—words, phrases,lines, paragraphs or parts of quotes. It’s sort of a placeholder indicating that you left out some text. That way it helps getting right to the point, not sweating unimportant details.

I know, these punctuation thingies don’t sound all too dashing, but this basic knowledge  of their use should be important for you if you like designing with good typography. On the one hand, it might seem trivial to have three sorts of dashes you can choose from because they look really similar, but on the other hand, a lot of care and consideration has been poured into these over the years and at least we should respect the work of designers who came long before us and on which typographical work we can easily build or work today. Paying attention to these little details is a little price to pay for standing on the shoulders of giants.

### Hyphen

No spaces around hyphens

The hyphen is used for justification ??

Their main purpose is to link words together: fine-art, 8-year-old 

They are your only choice for prefixes and suffixes as well.

If you wanna spell out a word, a hyphen can be used as well. T-U-T-S

Spanning time and distance is also part of their repository:
03:45-04:00 p.m.
1938-1945

For ranges like this, you can also you the en dash.

### En Dash

The en dash has its name from the length of the lowercase letter “n”. It is a little bit longer than a hyphen and is used for ranges of values, to imply relationships like master–student or can emphasize.

### Em Dash

The em dash is again a little bit longer, the size of the lowercase letter “m”. They should be used to emphasise a pause of thought and indicate that a sentence is unfinished.


Both dashes are a little bit thinner than a hyphen usually.
Please don’t just use two hyphens for stuff that en or em dashes are made for.

Both versions of dashes don’t require an extra space around them.

## Choosing Typefaces

We have tons of typefaces to choose from these days. And not only that, we have tons of services that wanna help us with that. It can take a while to get a sense what’s out there actually. But to me, that is entirely a good thing. A few years ago the options were a lot more limited and that was not a good thing. Web typography has come a long way, not only in terms of the ecosystem but in terms of what browsers let you do these days. 

When you decide on which typefaces you wanna go with, considerations are plenty! I’d recommend that you first of all focus on the readability and style that you want to convey in your designs. The tone and the message are also important since type has a huge influence through its various characteristics. If you can manage to do that, you will set yourself apart from the rest of the herd pretty significantly.

In the end, readability trumps everything though, especially for body copy. Headers can be a bit more expressive and creative. Since they only represent short bursts or text and are bigger usually, their readability can’t be that much compromised.

### Pairing Typefaces



Make sure that you create good contrast between the paired choices. Typefaces that look too similar can end up looking confusing and affect your visual hierarchy negatively. Bigger typefaces also have the benefit of so many options to vary this one typeface that you can only use one typeface without looking boring. That might be the easiest approach when you start out. There are so many weights and variations, that you will hardly shoot yourself in the foot. Pairing a Sans-Serif with a Serif typeface can easily lead to a good and interesting contrast that you can use to your advantage—stylistically.

But keep in mind, that you should use them consistently. You should not switch up the typeface for body copy and headers all over the place. Decide which one is best for readability and which one is best for conveying a style while grabbing the readers attention and stick to that. Otherwise you will make it harder for users to navigate your page because you failed at providing a subliminal mental map with your typography for your site. Worse, if users are confused and have a hard time to actually read what’s on a page.

Also, some type designers created Serif and Sans-Serif versions of a typeface which are supposed to work together nicely. When the type designer herself considered the pair, it’s really hard to go wrong when they kind of paired the typefaces for you already. Will this always work? Of course not. But it’s good to know when you look for new typefaces if they have a matching one with fitting contrast backed in from the start.

If you pair two typefaces, you want to have stronger visual differences between the two. Keep it subtle if you want, but it should be at least noticeable—even to the fast eye. In that regard, pairing two sans serifs or two serifs turns out to be tricky and does not achieve contrast that good.

While you look for visual distinctions, you also want to watch out for some sort of common trait. Something that can bind the two different typefaces together. Their visual structure, the way their letters are designed could share common ideas. That ties them together even more skillfully. A similar structure or geometric design will help with that.

On occasion steal. When you find combinations that you like, try them out yourself.

## Hierarchy

###### Screenshot

{% img /images/Typography-101/screenshots/typologic.png %}

It is important that you convey a strong hierarchy within your typography? Why? Because as we established at the beginning of this piece, your type on the page make for roughly 95% percent of your design. If you have weak hierarchy within your texts, you won’t have a snowballs chance in hell to create strong hierarchy in your overall design. Here are a few ways to strengthen your work in that department:

### Color

### Size

### Weight

### Strong contrast within paired typefaces

###### Screenshot

{% img /images/Typography-101/screenshots/hierarchy-pairing-contrast-trent-walton.png %}

Keep in mind that all of the above only shine if you use them consistently. If you change it up too much, your hierarchy will be weakened significantly. If all of this is complete news to you, I’d head over to my article about visual design principles to get you up to speed. All of the aforementioned will make a lot more sense then.

## Final Thoughts

A true ideal for your decisions with typography does not exist. In many matters it is very subjective and depending on which typeface you are working with. Take these ideas with a grain of salt and see them as starting point. Knowing common-sense limits is a good thing though. After you educated yourself some more about typography, you will run into many websites that obviously didn’t spend any time considering these guidelines that were handed down to us over many generations and will look a lot weaker because of that. It’s not magic to create better websites with good type but it’s rather surprising how many projects ignore these basic skills and muddy the waters for their readers.
