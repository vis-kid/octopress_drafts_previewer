## 95%

95 % of web design is typography! When you strip away all of the type of most websites, they basically implode. More or less, there is no web design without type. So why not get good at it and improve your web design skills by applying solid typography? There is a rich world full of letters to explore, a world which has been handed down to use by generations of creative people working with graphic design and type designers. Another amazing rabbit hole to dive into.

At first, web design naturally tried to follow a lot of the ideas of graphic design, especially how books, magazines and newspapers were laid out and designed. These days, designing or the web has matured a lot and does not follow these ideas as close as they used to. Designers adjusted their designs to the needs of the new medium and its capabilities. The industry realized that they can and must go further in some areas because we are talking about a digital medium that has different options. Responsive design is one example where design clearly matured over the print world in many, many ways. The flip side is, that this has also led to more complexity—which also seems to be ever increasing. To me, this does not sound threatening. Quite on the contrary, I feel this is very exciting and the possibilities are not only growing but the options today are already vast and cool. The web has grown up obviously—quite a bit—and the future seems bright!

As you can see, all the logos and icons in the world seem pretty much lost without the context of type. All the reason to give typography your full attention and make it your trusted go-to ally.

Type is more effective than anything else to convey your message on the web. Sure, graphics can support and enhance that, icons too, but communicating your users on happens mostly via the written word—in contrast to the advertising world, where images and graphics can convey whole stories a lot easier, even without using much written language at all. But on the web, we are talking about pages, sites and most of all interfaces. Dealing with mostly graphical elements for these media turned out to be difficult, often ineffective, ambiguous and not fit for the mass market. That is the main reason why the 95% statement is somewhat accurate and accepted in the industry.

This example from Dropbox also shows that the graphics alone don’t achieve the same level of communication and are ambiguous at best.

I’m sure we all have seen pages which are more on the experimental side, which heavily use graphical language—excluding type—to accomplish some design goal. But imagine a project like Facebook, Twitter or even Google going in that direction. I think it’s pretty much a sure bet that this would be a disaster—a huge one. So, type is king on the web. Like it or hate it, but ignoring it is not an option.

## Typefaces & Fonts

{% img /images/Typography-101/A_Specimen_by_William_Caslon.jpg %}

[Caslon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caslon)

### Typefaces

Typefaces are collections of letters, numbers and punctuations that form sets of styles for an alphabet. It’s sort of a family of type that share common design choices but can vary in weight and styles. Bodoni or Gotham for example would be typefaces. 

###### Gotham Typeface

{% img /images/Typography-101/screenshots/Gotham-typeface.png %}

### Fonts

This is somewhat of a subset of a typeface. It’s a character set of a particular typeface in one particular size, weight and style. Didot Light Roman 24pt (point) would be a font. Typefaces are usually made up of multiple fonts.

###### Didot Font

{% img /images/Typography-101/screenshots/Didot-light-roman.png %}

The other use of the word font applies to font files which render the typefaces at various sizes.

## Typographic Classifications

The classification for typefaces is a lot vaster—especially the subclassifications—than one might think at first. The essentials to start out with are quick to get a grip on though. Let’s look at a few classifications that you absolutely need to know, especially when your work includes mostly designing web stuff. I should also mention that I won’t bombard you with a wide array of typefaces that you should look into first. My goal is to teach you what you need to know to fish and not to spoon feed you for that matter. Also, the article would get even bigger and I might save this one for a later time. I want you to understand the basics and lingo first before you go out in the wild, hunting for typefaces yourself.

### Serif Typefaces

Serif typefaces are called after the little extensions, decorative details, at the end of some strokes of letters—serifs.

{% img /images/Typography-101/Serifs.png %}

Serif typefaces are the oldest we will discuss in this article. It’s not an exact science but arguments can be made that they go back as early as Romans carving letters into stones, using the Latin alphabet. There is also one interesting theory that says that they are a result of using chisels when carving stones and were an artistic choice due to the tools used to create a better end result.

Serifs are considered easier to read and are therefore often used for longer pieces of text like body copy. The evidence on that seems a bit inconclusive though. Nevertheless, this argument often comes up. They look more old school and classic but you can also make them look very modern. Depending on the context you apply serif text.

###### Screenshot The New York Times

Serifs are nevertheless an excellent choice for headers as well of course:

###### Screenshot Washington Post

[The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/)

###### The headers the Washington Post uses are a nice example of using a serif to convey a certain style of tradition and quality while the sans-serif body copy makes it look modern while being highly readable.

### Sans Serif Typefaces

These typefaces lack the serif extensions.

Sans serifs started to get popular in the 1920s and got rid of all the extra serif bits and pieces. They were designed to look modern, industrial and machine-made and were ideal for the advertisement industry. Since you can place more text in the same space—serif extensions take up more space of course—they were considered more economical as well.

### Semi Serif Typefaces

They incorporate both characteristics of serif and sans serif typefaces.

### Slab Serif Typefaces

{% img /images/Typography-101/slab-serif-rockwell.png 500 %}

Slab serifs are similar to serifs but are much thicker and more attention-grabbing in nature. In the past, they were often used for typewriters to make sure they create enough contrast on the page. In the early days, typewriters had a harder time being printing letters consistently on a page—depending on the pressure and the freshness of the ink and such. A slimmer serif would have been less effective for these machines. The early advertising industry also needed something new and attention-grabbing and made heavy use of slabs.

### Script Typefaces

These typefaces often emulate the look of hand-written text. The varying thickness and fluidity should be imitated with it.  Their look is more casual and informal and can often give the feel of something hand-crafted and personal. It’s often very decorative and not used for longer paragraphs of text—hopefully.

### Monospace Typefaces

As the name suggests, each letter and punctuation occupies the same horizontal width. The other typefaces we covered so far all have variable widths within their letters—also called proportional typefaces. Typewriters, early computers and terminals were heavily using this kind of type. The hardware did not accommodate the needs for variable widths of other type families. The graphical limitations were enormous in those days of course. Today’s text editors for writing code still offer monospaced fonts by default. Maybe, nothing speaks “hacker” more clearly if its written in monospace. In the last few years it has also become a lot more popular among designers—a bit hip actually.

## Typographic Anatomy

We will go over some of the most important anatomic features of type. The stuff that is really good to know and useful if you have conversations about type. But I feel like I should mention that you don’t need to deep dive on all of these features just to become dangerous at this. It’s good to know, for sure, but there are more important things to memorize I think. Obviously, obsessive type nerds might find it funny if you are unaware of “terminals” and stuff, but honestly who gives a damn—much bigger fish to fry. Plus, it’s not always about the technical details. Being a “technician” in this regard is maybe not that important.

Your job is to get creative with the typefaces themselves, not recite every minute detail of how they are composed. It’s all about what you do, what you achieve when you put typefaces to “work”. So my advice is simple, understand and memorize the basics, have fun, play around with the typefaces and soak it in over time. There is nothing wrong with not knowing every single detail about type anatomy! On the other hand, maybe I’m overly pragmatic about this. You decide!

### Baseline

{% img /images/Typography-101/baseline-01.png %}

The baseline is where most of the letters are placed upon.

### Median

{% img /images/Typography-101/median.png %}

The median on the other hand is the line where most lowercase letters end, where they terminate.

### X-Height

{% img /images/Typography-101/x-height.png %}

The space between the baseline and the median is what we call x-height. Most of the time it represents the height of the lowercase letter “x”—therefore its name. The more x-height a font offers, the more readable it will end up usually. Why? Because most of the text we read in the western world is comprised of lowercase letters. So a lot of the characteristics of words are expressed in lowercase—all the small distinctions that help us identify individual letters and quickly build them up to words. All these little identifiers are heavily comprised in this little x-height zone—not only, but the lion’s share for sure.

 This extra space gives a font a bit more opportunity to let its character shine through. I guess it makes sense that if you have a small x-height, the eyes has less detail or less information to quickly make sense of letters and put them in the context of words. Sure you can always read letter by letter and piece the info together like that, but most of us tend to read in jumps and consume letters a lot faster and also more subconsciously. So more x-height is good for body copy because long paragraphs of text can get tiresome if the eyes have to work harder to decipher the alphabet. Sections like titles where you will generally user bigger font sizes and shorter amounts of text anyway, can get away with less than optimal x-heights. You have more room for artistic choices that imply maybe a certain mood or character without affecting the reading experience of your users too badly.

### Ascender

{% img /images/Typography-101/Typographic_ascenders.png %}

The ascender is that part that stretches above the median.

### Descender

{% img /images/Typography-101/Typographic_descenders.png %}

This part of a letter extends below the baseline.

### Counter

Counters are areas that are partially or fully enclosed. Think of an “o” or an “a”. The “a” for example has two counters—one that is partially and one that is fully enclosed. Typefaces with larger counters are usually also good for readability because the details have more room to be explicitly shown. So look for typefaces with large x-heights and larger counters if you are interested in giving users a good reading experience.

{% img /images/Typography-101/counters.png %}

## Spacings

### Line Height

{% img /images/Typography-101/line-height.png %}

This is the space between two consequent baselines. In print, it’s very important to create a consistent vertical rhythm—the baseline grid—a mini grid system for type on a page. On the web, the line-height that browsers render does not play ball and does not allow us to easily achieve this kind of typographical grid system. Vertical rhythm would be nice because you can place every piece of type on a consistent grid that goes down the page. The overall effect is very pleasing and we are probably all used to it from reading books and such.

###### Baseline Grid

{% img /images/Typography-101/screenshots/baseline-grid.jpg %}

On the web, this tends out to be tiresome to achieve and not worth pursuing all that much—unless you are going for some typographical project that imitates print or something. Also, considering responsive environments makes applying baseline grids even less appealing. In the end, it most likely is not worth the bang for the buck and can only achieved with significant efforts. The future might provide more effective and more convenient solutions for course. Let’s see! If you wanna do the math and have a good reason to create a baseline grid on the web then go for it. Otherwise, your time might be better invested in more pragmatic matters.

A good line height for paragraphs on the web usually lies between 1.3–1.6em. Titles can and should be a bit tighter. This is a good starting point to achieve rather nice readability. Trust your gut and try out various line heights until you achieve a visually pleasing result. It’s not so much about precise math. For shorter paragraphs that don’t span as much, you can apply less line height. But again, every typeface needs its own height to breath appropriately. A good benchmark to keep in mind is that you want to be able to jump to the start of the next line rather easily. You don’t want to burden users with some sort of mental overhead, needing to look hard where they should continue to read when they reach the end of a line of text.

In the end, typefaces can be very different from each other and need individual tweaks that can’t be determined by generalized numbers. Varying degrees of line height affect the color of your text. That means that tighter line heights look darker since the micro white space between lines of text gets reduced—and vice versa of course. Finding a balance so that text that looks coherent, light and readable is your goal while adjusting this measure. You definitely want to avoid having too tight line height where the text becomes visually darker or lines that seem to almost crash into each other. Lines of body copy that seem to float apart and create an incoherent sea of text is the other extreme to avoid. Read the text, use real text not dummy ipsum and see how it feels. Is it a good reading experience? This should be on top of your mind—always!

### Line Length / Measure

{% img /images/Typography-101/measure.png %}

Both mean the same thing. It consists of the number of characters on a single line of text. A good measure for designs on the web lies between 60–85 characters. Line length and line height are somewhat symbiotic and depend on each other. The more line length a paragraph needs, the more line height should be incorporated. The same advice about your instincts applies here as well. If it looks too cramped or too stretchy, adjust it until it’s readable and “feels” right. Obviously you will need experience to achieve good results when you follow your gut—math is only getting you so far.

### Kerning

{% img /images/Typography-101/Kerning2.png %}

Kerning is referred to as adjusting the varying micro white space between individual letters. This is differently conceived by every type design, complying with the needs of each letter. A lowercase “o” might occupy lesser space and a lowercase “t’ for example. On the web this is tedious to adjust while the practice of kerning is very prevalent in the print industry. On the web, this involves unreasonable amounts of JavaScript or span wrappers that are not really scalable. For titles and logotypes you can go that route and you sometimes even need to do that. Lots of typefaces that are designed for smaller sizes tend to need a bit of extra kerning when you display them at bigger font sizes. On the other hand, there are also typefaces that are designed for exactly that scenario and have the appropriate kerning already baked in.

### Letter Spacing / Tracking

{% img /images/Typography-101/Letter-spacing.png 600 %}

This refers to the consistent spacing between all of the letters in a group. It does not target individual letters like kerning, but it’s rather a uniform adjustment that spans across the entire affected text passage. It results in more or less density and texture. When you use larger pieces of text, for titles for example, a little bit of negative letter spacing can go a long way. You don’t want to create the impression that the text is drifting apart. As with kerning, when typefaces are designed to be consumed at smaller font sizes, the letter spacing might need these little nudges since the original kerning was considered differently.

## Punctuations

### Quotation Marks

{% img /images/Typography-101/Dumb_quotes_vs_curly_quotes.jpg 400 %}

Use real quotes. Period! The other “quotes” that are used by most people are actually straight quotes—which should be used for inches and feet.They are also called “dumb quotes”—not something you wanna use. Apostrophes and single quotes also have their real counterpart. Yes, you need to do some finger kung-fu on your keyboard to get them, but you are making yourself look bad and inexperienced if you ignore them.

### Ellipsis

{% img /images/Typography-101/ellipsis.png %}

An ellipsis refers to the three dots that can easily be mistaken as three single periods. The difference is that they have more spacing between each period. You can use extra space to the left and right, up to you to decide. There is no standard for it at the moment. You use it when you want to omit stuff—words, phrases,lines, paragraphs or parts of quotes. It’s sort of a placeholder indicating that you left out some text. That way it helps getting right to the point.

### Hyphen

{% img /images/Typography-101/dashes.png %}

There is no need for extra spaces around hyphens. Their main purpose is to link words together, like fine-art, 8-year-old and such. They are your only choice for prefixes and suffixes as well. You should also use them if you wanna spell out a word: T-U-T-S. Spanning time and distance is also part of their repository:

+ 03:45-04:00 p.m.
+ 1938-1945

For these ranges you can also you the en dash.

### En Dash

The en dash has its name from the length of the lower-case letter “n”. It is a little bit longer than a hyphen and is used for ranges of values as well as for implying relationships like master–student. Or for emphasis.

### Em Dash

The em dash is again a little bit longer, the size of the upper-case letter “m”. They should be used to emphasise a pause of thought and indicate that a sentence is unfinished. Both dashes can appear a little bit thinner than a hyphen—usually. Please don’t just use two hyphens for stuff that en or em dashes are made for. Also, both versions of dashes don’t require an extra space around them.

I know, these punctuation thingies don’t sound all too dashing, but this basic knowledge of how to use them properly should be important for you if you like designing with good typography in mind. It also might seem trivial to have three sorts of dashes you can choose from because they look really similar, but on the other hand, a lot of care and consideration has been poured into these over the years and at least we should respect the work of designers who came long before us. It is their hard work and pioneering that makes it so easy to build upon today. Let’s pay some respect to their work. Paying attention to these details is a small price to pay for standing on the shoulders of giants.

## Hierarchy

[Typologic](http://www.typologic.nl/)

It is important that you convey a strong hierarchy within your typography? Why? Because as we established at the beginning of this piece, the type on the page make for roughly 95% percent of your design. If you have weak hierarchy within your texts, you won’t have a snowballs chance in hell to create strong hierarchy in your overall design.

Typography offers you multiple ways to give your users visual anchors to navigate your site the way you want them to. Through emphasis you can let them know what is most important and what they should pay attention to first. Here are a few ways to strengthen your work in that department:

### Color

If you don’t have much color on a page it is very easy to guide the eye towards it. As always, less is more. Because the examples below only used it sparingly the effect is very strong—even without increasing the size or additional white space. That way it can look very elegant.

###### Screenshots

[Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/news)

### Size

Increasing the font size always works of course. The eyes register something more easily if it sticks out in size and the reader assumes it’s more important. The thing I like about varying font sizes is that you can easily create visual “anchors” the reader can use to jump around on a page. The only caveat is that you really need to be consistent with the use of font sizes for particular elements. You can not change it up at will all over the place. That would most likely weaken your designs much more than having uniform sized text.

### White Space

White space is the most powerful ingredient that can make you look either very elegant or very inexperienced. You should give important typographical elements room to breath. If they are surrounded by empty space they are emphasised simply by that. White space is a whole nother topic which I covered in my article about visual design basics. One question often comes up: how much white space does one need? Well, the answer sounds douchy but it would be: “just enough”. For now my advice would be to err on the flip side and rather give it too much white space than too little. Newcomers seem to shy away a bit from using much space between elements. In print this can be costly, but on the web you get this stuff for free. Play around, watch out what other designers come up with and steal on occasion. No magic and no rocket science though. Just a little experience is all you need—eventually you will develop a good gut measure.

### Weight

If you have big typeface families you will have lots of options to choose your weights. In many of the examples above you can observe various weights for different purposes at work. For me, this is not something I jump to right away and usually try the other tools to create hierarchy first. But this is a matter of taste, whatever works best for you and your designs.

###### Screenshot

{% img /images/Typography-101/screenshots/weight-dropbox-about.png %}

[Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/about)

In the screenshot from the Dropbox about page you can see that the names have a different weight than their titles. A very basic technique for creating emphasis. Me personally would have probably increased the font size since there is enough space for even long names. The hierarchy would have been even stronger that way.

### Italics

Similar to the arguments about pure weight, italics can also strengthen the hierarchy. Due to its different look it can stand out, even if you don’t increase its size, change its color or weight. I would not use it for other than secondary or tertiary kinds of information in running text. The example below makes good use of it for displaying the address. It sticks out a bit but not too much. This whole example has real great hierarchy and the italics part just adds to it.

### Strong contrast within paired typefaces

When you choose more than one typeface for your work—avoid choosing more than two btw—it becomes critical that these typefaces themselves create some sort of hierarchy through strong enough contrast. On the one hand they should be easily distinguishable from each other and on the other hand also not too unrelated. Sounds hard, I know, in fact it really is. We all gotta deal with it. But there are a few good guidelines that make it not that crazy when living in a world with a gazillion typefaces. The next chapter brings you up to speed on this one.

Keep in mind that all of the above only shine if you use them consistently. If you change it up too much, your hierarchy will be weakened significantly. If all of this is complete news to you, I’d head over to my article about visual design principles to get you up to speed. All of the aforementioned will make a lot more sense after that.

## Choosing Typefaces

We have tons of typefaces to choose from these days. And not only that, we have tons of services that wanna help us with that. It can take a while to get a sense what’s out there actually. But to me, that is entirely a good thing. A few years ago the options were a lot more limited and that was not better either. Web typography has come a long way, not only in terms of the ecosystem but in terms of what browsers let you do these days. 

When you decide which typefaces you wanna go with, considerations are plenty! I’d recommend that you first of all focus on the readability and style that you want to convey in your designs. The tone and the message are also important since type has a huge influence on this through its various characteristics that often represent more than “just” time periods. If you can manage to do all that, you will set yourself apart from the rest of the herd pretty significantly.

In the end, readability trumps everything though—especially for body copy. Obviously, headers can be a bit more expressive and creative since they only represent short bursts or text and are usually bigger. Their readability can’t be that that easily compromised.

### Pairing Typefaces

###### Screenshot

[Kitchen Sink Studios](http://www.kitchensinkstudios.com/work/frances/)

Make sure that you create good contrast between the paired choices. Typefaces that look too similar can end up looking confusing and affect your visual hierarchy negatively. Bigger typeface families also have the benefit of having tons of options to vary this one typeface. That way you can only use one typeface without looking boring. That might be the easiest approach when you start out. There are so many weights and variations that you will hardly shoot yourself in the foot too bad. If you wanna go further than that then pairing a sans serif with a serif typeface is the best place to start—the most reasonable actually. This can lead to a stronger and more interesting contrast that you can use to your advantage—stylistically.

{% img /images/Typography-101/screenshots/hansonwu-com.png %}

[Hanson Wu](http://hansonwu.com/#/work/how_to_order_eggs)

But keep in mind, that you should use these choices consistently. Avoid switching up the typefaces for body copy and headers all over the place. Decide which one is best for readability and which one is best for conveying a style while grabbing the readers attention and stick to that. Otherwise you will make it harder for users to navigate your page because you failed at providing a subliminal mental map for your site through your typography. Worse, if users are confused and have a hard time to actually read what’s on a page.

Some type designers created serif and sans serif versions of a typeface. These are supposed to work together neatly. When the type designer herself considered the pair, it’s really hard to go wrong when they kind of paired the typefaces already for you. Will this always work? Of course not! But it’s good to know when you look for new typefaces. When they have a matching sibling you might find a fitting contrast baked in from the start.

If you pair two typefaces, you want to have strong visual differences between the two—but in my mind only strong enough. Going overboard does not do the trick for me. Keep it subtle if you want, but it should be at least noticeable—even to the fast eye. In that regard, pairing two sans serifs or two serifs turns out to be tricky and does not achieve contrast that good.

While you look for visual distinctions, you also want to watch out for some sort of common trait. Something that can bind the two different typefaces together. Their visual structure, the way their letters are designed could share common ideas. Similar counters and similar skeletons of their overall letters for example. That ties them together even more skillfully. A similar structure or geometric design will help with that for sure. On occasion steal! When you find combinations that you like, try them out yourself and see what you can do with them. Learning through imitating the work of others is fine. At some point you won’t be that exciting anymore and hunting for your next new typeface becomes a lot more exhilarating than building upon the creative choices of others. That’s where the fun begins actually. Hope to see you on the other side!

## Final Thoughts

Typography lacks hard laws to guide your decisions. To me that is a good thing though. In many regards, typography is very subjective but readability might be the one constant you should always focus on first and foremost. Take all these ideas and concepts above with a grain of salt and see them as starting points for your own creative explorations. Rules would be boring anyway. Knowing some common-sense and agreed upon limits is a good thing though. Maybe attend a letterpress workshop in your area and learn a bit about print design. Decide on a handful of typefaces and get to know them intimately by overusing them for a while.

After you have educated yourself some more about typography, you will run into many websites that obviously didn’t spend any time considering these guidelines. You will learn that there is a lot of room to infuse the web with better typography. It is such a great tool to enhance communication and I feel it is culturally precious knowledge that was handed down to us over many generations of hard work and explorations. It’s fantastic how you can influence the tone of written language with it. Overall, it’s not magic to create better websites with good type and it’s rather surprising how many projects ignore these basic skills and muddy the waters for their readers. You can do better than that!
