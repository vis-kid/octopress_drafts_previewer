This two-part mini-series was written for people who quickly wanna jump into working with this gem and cut to the chase without digging through the documentation for themselves. 

I did my best to keep it newbie-friendly for folks who started to play with tests rather recently. Obviously having been in the same shoes made me believe that it doesnâ€™t take much to make new people feel more comfortable with testing. Taking a bit more time to explain the context and demystifying the lingo goes a long way in cutting down frustration rates for beginners imho.
