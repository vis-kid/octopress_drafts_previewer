## Hue

Basic colors
A color or shade that is discernable by red, green, blue, ...
can have different variastions, different colors of red

## Tint & Shade

??Tint-Tone: the amount of white in a color
??Value-Shade: the amount of black in a color

Good if you wanna focus on only one or two colors
creating variatons on that
playing with main colors
more options
playing off of it
within the same color
vary your color but stay wihint same color choice

## Color Wheel

Relationships between the colors
helps to choose color

Primary colors: Red, Yellow, Blue
You can’t mix any other colors to get them. -> are like constants if you like. fixed

Secondary colors: Green, orange, purple
are mixed from primary colors

Tertiary colors 




Two types of color:

## Warm Colors

Right side of the color wheel
more attention grabbing,
strong, engergetic, really strong, fast attention
render problems??
color vibrate


## Cool Colors

Green, blue, purple
Left side of the color wheel
Tend to fade into the background
calm, stable, recede on page
more comforting, stable, enriching
usually a save bet, very popular
lots of site online using it,
does not jump out so much

## Netural Colors

not within color wheel
supporting colors
black, brown, white
?? Gray scale??

## Complimentary Colors

oppposite on the color wheel
like serif and sans serif in typography
they work really well together 
contrast well to each other
good first step usually

## Analogous Colors

Right next to each other on the color wheel
creating a realationship
right direction for matching colors

## Matching Colors

Similar to choosing typefaces
Choose one or utmost two major, design dominating colors
A “primary” color
Keep it simple
Start with one dominant color
Slowly put colors in
Bounce other colors off of that
Support and enhance dominant colors with supporting colors
-> Adjust value, tone, brightness, saturation or use neutral colors
Color scheme by bouncing off the main color

## Emphasis

If you use your primary color very sparsely, you can create a very effective emphasis. 
You want to avoid washing it down too much and waste the opportunity to hightlight key design elements
focus on elements
works great with gray scale usually
save it for important stuff
very sparsely
very dominant on the page
pop forward
other colors fade back that way and support main color

## Consistency

Keeping links the same color that do the same thing
Keeping header colors consistent
keeping background colors that similar
most acitionable items can stick out-> not consistent
mental map
A lot more classy look achieve
Setting expectations that you want to make easy for users to follow and understand
