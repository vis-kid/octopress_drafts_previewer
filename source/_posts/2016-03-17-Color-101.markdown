## Color?

Color can be a very powerful “weapon” in your artistic repertoire—if yielded appropriately. On the other hand, nothing makes you look like a poser as fast as inconsidered applyance of color. Trust me, I’ve been there and in hindsight you want to kick yourself hard for not paying more attention.

The topic of colors is a HUGE one—gigantic actually. We will focus on the most important aspects and terms to get you started—teaching you the lingo so to speak. 

With colors there are a lot of considerations, especially if you need to think about branding. But foremost, I’d focus on making it interesting, chossing colors that have meaning and create interest.

Try to avoid having muddy colors where you loose the distinct quality the colors at your disposal. On the web, you definitly want to use color to create a certain mood, vibe or whatever and also to highlight stuff that are of particuluar imoportance. As with design principles, less is more. If everything is highlighted via color, nothing sticks out and you will end up with color noice—which is the worst becaus it is not interesting at all.

Color is also about the emotional and visual impact.

Color creates mood, an emotional impact

Colors, if used correctly, can guide viewers to what’s important. Probably the most important thing when using color on web projects.

can be powerful mood changer

On computers you pick colors by choosing its hue, saturation and value

No light, no color. The color disappears. Without darkness, the colors disappear too.
Light and darkness together make colors visible.

## Hue

{% img /images/Color-101/Hue-scale.png %}

Most of the time when people talk about colors, they might actually be talking about hues. They are like basic colors or pure colors. That means it’s any color that is within the visible light spectrum. The healthy human eye can see 2.3 Mio hues. They don’t have tint or shade—meaning they lack any additions of white or black (see next section).
So tons of different variations of reds, blues, greens and so on.

Like their raw, most primitive version

## Tint & Shade

{% img /images/Color-101/tint-tone-shade.png %}

Tint
Adding white to the pure hue decreases its saturation

Shade
Adding black to the pure hue decreases its value

Tint is about the amount of white in a color. When you mix a color with white you are tinting it. This leads to increased lightness of the hue the more white you add.

Shade is about the amount of black in a color. When you mix a color with black you are shading it. This leads to reduced lightness of the hue the more black you add.

In regards to both of the above, we are talking about tints and shades of particular hues.

###### Tint-Hue-Shade Spectrum:

{% img /images/Color-101/tint-shade-spectrum.png 800 %}

As you can see here, in the middle is the pure hue. Towards the left direction, we add more and more white by tinting it and to the right we are shading the red with black.


#### Value

The degree of lightness or darkness of a hue
how light or dark a hue is
tints or shades of a hue

#### Tone

The tone of a hue is its relative darkness / lightness. It’s about the amount of light that is reflected by that hue. The lighter the more light get’s reflected back and the darker the more ligth gets absorbed. We speak of tone when we mix a color with gray—which means that you effectively tint and shade it because adding both white and black results in gray of course.

## Chroma

Chroma, the saturation, is another term we should not overlook. It’s the “colorfulness” of a hue. That funky term just translates to the intensity or brilliance of a perceived color. The chroma is defining how pure the hues is.

Chroma colors are the colors that you take right off the tube when you buy colors for painting.

Desaturation means the color is washed out or grayed out.
Desaturated colors are often used as shadow colors.

We reduce saturation by adding grey to it (black and white). So we would be toning the hue.

Desaturate a hue by adding a complimentary color. It’s important to uderstand that we are not adding gray for this. You are creating a gray but not by adding black or white. ??Contrast of saturations
These grays break up your saturated colors.
Don’t want to bombard viewers with intense color saturations

Blue and orange for example. Next to each other they would be very intense. If you mix these colors you have this gray tone that can separate them really well. The color stands in between those highly saturated ones.

Create a barrier between the colors to percevie them separately. When you talk about masters in painting, this is one of the things they tried to master.

Good if you wanna focus on only one or two colors
creating variatons on that
playing with main colors
more options
playing off of it
within the same color
vary your color but stay wihint same color choice

highly saturated colors can look incredibly fake.
too much of it gives your eyes not much rest

anchor your eyes or the viewers attention when only few parts are selectivly highly saturated

The more of the opposite color you add the more you desaturate it, the less pure it becomes. It becomes more dull. We are dealing with intensity. Where both colors meet, you have your neutral color point -> brown, gray

## The Grays

Are a mix of the shadow colors, which is the desaturated version by mixing it with its complimentary color, and mixing the shadow color with white.

## Color Wheel

The three dark colors, dark spectrum -> secondary colors?
The three light colors, light spectrum -> primary colors?
Goethe incoroprated both light and dark spectra in his color wheel, he called it the harmonic color wheel -> which we use today
Green forms the base of Goethes color wheel. It’s the blend of the two primary colors yellow and blue
Magenta forms the top of the color wheel. It arises as a blend of red and violet


!!!We get a color wheel by taking the spectrum of light and through connecting both ends to a circle.
Relationships between the colors
The color wheel can easily tell you how to create the biggest color contrast possible
The color wheel is not so much of a scientific thing but more how our brain works—maybe even emotional in terms of contrast and what respsones color awake. By scientifially, I mean there are not opposite colors in that regard—that’s only in our brains or in the concepts we put together to organize / distinguish colors.
helps to choose color

Primary colors: Red, Yellow, Blue
You can’t mix any other colors to get them. -> are like constants if you like. fixed
Can not be made by mixing ohter colors
Are used to create all other colors

Secondary colors: Green, orange, purple
are mixed from primary colors

Tertiary colors 




Two types of color:

## Warm Colors


Right side of the color wheel
more attention grabbing,
strong, engergetic, really strong, fast attention
render problems??
color vibrate
active colors

You can also have a cold red and a warm red
But you can also have warm blue and cold blue for example


## Cool Colors

Green, blue, purple
Left side of the color wheel
Tend to fade into the background
calm, stable, recede on page
more comforting, stable, enriching
usually a save bet, very popular
lots of site online using it,
does not jump out so much
passive colors


Golden aera
Feeling blue

## Netural Colors

Neutral colors taking two complimentary paris
get gray or brown neutral
on the other side is saturation
neturals bind everything together
provide a break from the intensity of the bright colors
bright colors attract the eye
neutrals provide interest and variation
combined with saturated colors, neutrals recede while saturated come forward, at you.
neutrals are very versatile
they are part of a great color vocabulary
subtle, subtle colors
they create a balance in your work
if everything is shouting, I mean highly saturated, pure color, nothing is focused. Seems also really flat
build up with mostly neutral tones. then decide where the focus is and where the eye is supposed to be attracted to. that’s where you put the saturated tones
Tone everything down, don’t make it so bright
Everything bright seems childish and amateurish
not within color wheel
supporting colors
black, brown, white
?? Gray scale??

## Color Harmonies

Some color look better together than others. Probably a term that comes from musical harmonies.

### Monochromatic
easy
one color
single subjects
details of image focus

### Analogous Colors

Adjacent on the color wheel
Easy on the eyes
Peaceful, comfortable mood -> often seen in nature
Right next to each other on the color wheel
creating a realationship
right direction for matching colors

### Triadic Colors

Equally distant on the wheel
Hard to get right
More of an advanced combination
Good for cartoon and surreal scenes
Can imply playfulness

### Complimentary Colors

Opposing each other on the wheel
Very popular combination
“Naturally” pleasing to the eye
Don’t use them equally -> decide on one dominant color -> generally the weaker color (-> the colder color more??)
Red and green especially popular


oppposite on the color wheel
like serif and sans serif in typography
they work really well together 
About color contrast as well
contrast well to each other
good first step usually

There are more variations but this should give you a great start for now.

## Matching Colors

Similar to choosing typefaces
Choose one or utmost two major, design dominating colors
A “primary” color
Keep it simple
Start with one dominant color
Slowly put colors in
Bounce other colors off of that
Support and enhance dominant colors with supporting colors
-> Adjust value, tone, brightness, saturation or use neutral colors
Color scheme by bouncing off the main color

## Emphasis

If you use your primary color very sparsely, you can create a very effective emphasis. 
You want to avoid washing it down too much and waste the opportunity to hightlight key design elements
focus on elements
works great with gray scale usually
save it for important stuff
very sparsely
very dominant on the page
pop forward
other colors fade back that way and support main color

## Consistency

Keeping links the same color that do the same thing
Keeping header colors consistent
keeping background colors that similar
most acitionable items can stick out-> not consistent
mental map
A lot more classy look achieve
Setting expectations that you want to make easy for users to follow and understand

## Color Meaning

In various cultures, colors can imply different meanings or associations.
Also evoke different feelings therefore
Need to take that into consideration if you design for different cultures
These are bit silly in my opinion but it’s nevertheless good to have seen these associations and commit them to memory. Everybody sees colors differently. Maybe for we stuff where you  don’t have to mix a ton of colors to create skin tons for example this is alright, but imagine useing these guidelines when you paint a stilleben with a vase of flowers in front of an open window looking out to a farm. It would be silly to think about all these color associations, no?

## Color Palletes

On occasion steal and adapt them for your own designs
See how designers use color pairs
Learning through imitations is fine

... Website list for color palettes

## Color Relativity

We were talking about cooler and warmer colors but it’s a bit more relative that that. Color can appear that way in reltation to another. Colors can look warmer or colder depending on the enviroment they are in. Our human eye is a bit foolish that way.
