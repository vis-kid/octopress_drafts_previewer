## Color?

Without light there is no color right? Well, actually without “darkness” there is no color either. Huh? I know, sounds strange at first but without darkness, colors disappear as well. Do we need to know stuff like this when we pick colors on our computers—choosing its hue, saturation and value? Probably not! Could color theory blow your mind every once in a while and make you a more effective web designer and therefore a better “communicator”? Absolutely! In terms of colors we all have a ton of opinions and emotions but often people have not a clear idea what they are actually doing. Going with your gut is fine of course but having a theoretic basis to build upon makes you much more effective as a design person. Art school is not something most people spend a significant time of their lives at, but you don’t need to spend years to bend colors to our needs. So let’s get you up to speed.

With colors there are a lot of considerations you wouldn’t expect right away. A little bit of a warning, it can be a rabbit hole you never get out of—and we are not even talking about branding and stuff. To compensate for that, I propose that first and foremost, you might focus on making it interesting for your users while making reasonable and effective choices that support your design. This seems like a manageable goal for color newbies. I realize this sounds super puffy, but subjectivity is not something that you can shake off when talking about colors. Let’s just say that we can agree that choosing colors that have meaning and create interest is a good place to start.

Color can be a very powerful “weapon” in your artistic or creative repertoire—if yielded appropriately of course. On the other hand, nothing makes you look like a poser as fast as ill considered appliance of color. Trust me, I’ve been there and in hindsight you want to kick yourself hard for not paying more attention. For our designs on the web, color often is about the emotional and visual impact. If used correctly, they can guide viewers to what’s important and add emphasis if you don’t overdo it. I guess it’s fair to say that this is probably the most important thing when using color on web projects. A secondary concern is that you can establish a certain mood, an emotional impact that takes branding ideas even further. This whole topic is a HUGE one—gigantic actually. We will focus on the most important aspects and terms to get you started.

## Hue

A hue is any color on the color wheel.

{% img /images/Color-101/Hue-scale.png %}

A lot of the time when people talk about colors, they are actually talking about hues—which are the basic, “pure” colors. That means any color that is within the visible light spectrum. The healthy human eye can see 2.3 Mio hues. 
So tons of different variations of reds, blues, greens and so on.

For our work with colors in design, they represent starting points, like raw or the most primitive versions. In our designs, we mostly need to leave these behind to avoid looking amateurish or childish. Did you ever notice that cartoons for kids like to use these colors for their characters? Not a big surprise I guess. You can make use of this of course if you go for a certain look but most of the time childish is not what works too well on the web. 

## Tint, Shade & Tone

Hues don’t have tint or shade—which means they lack any additions of white or black. That’s why We are talking about tints and shades of particular hues. Tint is about the amount of white in a color. When you mix a color with white you are tinting it. This leads to increased lightness of the hue the more white you add. Adding white to the pure hue decreases its saturation. They make the hue less intense. 

Shade on the other hand is about the amount of black in a color. When you mix a color with black you are shading it. This leads to reduced lightness of the hue the more black you add. This results in a rich, often darker more intense color due to the overpowering nature of black pigments. Many blacks change the characteristics of a hue—even through small amounts. Therefore they should be used sparingly. As you can see below, in the middle is the pure hue. Towards the left direction, we add more and more white by tinting it and to the right we are shading the red with black.

###### Tint-Hue-Shade Spectrum:

{% img /images/Color-101/tint-shade-spectrum.png 800 %}

The “tone” of a hue is its relative darkness / lightness. It’s about the amount of light that is reflected by that hue. The lighter the more light get’s reflected back and the darker the more light gets absorbed. We speak of creating tones when we mix a hue with gray—which means that you effectively tint and shade it because adding both white and black results in some sort of gray of course. Tones can be lighter or darker than the original hue—depending on the amount of white and black added. They will also appear less saturated and intense than the original hue. Tones can reveal subtle and complex qualities in a hue. They are closer to the way we see the “real” world.

{% img /images/Color-101/tint-tone-shade.png %}

## Value

Value is the lightness or darkness of a hue. Values are very, very crucial for professional results. In a way, they are much more important to get correct than choosing a hue. When we say something is bright or dark, we are talking about the value of a hue. This tells us how close it is to its lightest or darkest version. A value scale is like a gray scale for a particular hue.

{% img /images/Color-101/color-schemes-monochromatic.png 600 %}

The sections on the scale are called steps. They are significant color steps that can be clearly distinguished by being significantly lighter or darker than the next step. If you apply these values you achieve better tonal contrast by using realistic lights and shades. The end result is more vibrant, interesting and looks simply a lot more professional.

A lot of the great paintings we collectively admire in art history were done by artists that were masters at subtle tonal contrast via proper use of value scales. They achieved variations of depth by gradual value changes of a limited number of hues. As you can see from the image below, a simple gray scale is all you need to establish enough tonal contrast for painting effectively. A few tinted highlights, are few dark shades and a lot of medium values that define the majority of the painting.

{% img /images/Color-101/Odin_disguised_as_a_Traveller_value_scale.png %}

Of course this works not only with gray scales but with monochromatic colors as well—meaning with one hue. Think of it as the lights and shades of a hue.

{% img /images/Color-101/Andreas_Achenbach_Clearing_Up—Coast_of_Sicily_Walters.jpg %}

You can see how effective this scale is by desaturating the painting. The values do not change when you gray out the color. The lightest lights and the darkest darks still define an effective range.

{% img /images/Color-101/Andreas_Achenbach_Clearing_Up—Coast_of_Sicily_Walters-grayed-out.png %}

Interestingly, every color has its own inherent range of values. Some have a bigger range than others. Red for example has a more limited range compared to a blue hue for example. Red is in the low gray-scale range, the value is very dark. Yellow on the other hand is in the high-range. Green, violet and blue have the largest range going from dark to light.

{% img /images/Color-101/color-values-mirrored.png 400 %}

Why do we care? Values are an effective way to render a two-dimensional depiction on any canvas and let it appear three-dimensional using the relative shades of a hue. This is what people call more alive or vibrant—in contrast to flat colors that fail to achieve this effect. This is why you want in general more desaturated tones, pure hues are of little help in that regard and look immature on top of that. A good tip is to start with only one hue and develop a value scale for your website. You can use various values for highlighting areas and other that recede gently in the background—all while staying simple and classy.

Or think of iconic black and white photographs of the last 50 years or so. The often have a wide range of steps on the gray-scale and create a stronger, more interesting contrast—ranging from very dark blacks to very bright whites. Amateurs often end up with flat black and white images because they are unaware of the need to make them more vibrant with a broader gray-scale.  

## Saturation / Chroma

The saturation, also called Chroma, is another term we should not overlook. It’s the “colorfulness” or purity of a hue. These funky terms just translates to the intensity or brilliance of a perceived color. The chroma is defining how pure the hues is. When you buy colors for painting, chromas are the colors that you take right off the tube. In constrast to that, desaturated colors are washed out or grayed out. These colors are often used as shadow colors of various degrees. A completely desaturated color is gray.

Remember to desaturate a hue by adding a complimentary color. Everything added from the opposite of the color wheel will desaturate the hue very effectively—very artistically some might say. The more of the opposite color you add the more you desaturate it—the less pure it becomes. It gets more dull. In all of this, We are still dealing with intensity. Where both colors meet, you have your neutral color point—brown or gray. It’s important to understand that we are not adding gray for this. In effect you are creating a gray but not by adding black or white. These grays are used by painters to break up saturated colors. Why is that a good idea? The answer is actually very practical: you don’t want to bombard viewers with intense color saturations everywhere—quite on the contrary. Highly saturated colors can look incredibly fake and cheap as well. Too much of it gives your eyes not much chance to rest—and also nothing to really focus on—more of a visual noise.

Take blue and orange for example. Next to each other they would be very intense. If you mix these colors you have this gray tone that can separate their more saturated applications really well. This new color stands in between those highly saturated ones and create a more visually pleasing experience by applying more realistic colors. As fluffy as this sounds, it has more vibrancy, more life. This creates a barrier between the colors that is more mature in technique. When you talk about masters in painting, this is one of the things they tried to get a firm grip on.

###### “Impression, soleil levant” by Claude Monet

{% img /images/Color-101/Claude_Monet,_Impression.jpg %}

It’s good if you wanna focus on only one or two colors and create variatons from them by mixing their desaturated versions with their complimentary colors. That way, you have a lot of options within the same color. You can vary your color but stay within the same color hue(s). Also, you are more easily able to anchor your viewer’s eyes or their attention when only few parts are selectivly highly saturated. In the image above, it is hard to not look at the sun, no? It really jumps out like that.

## Color Wheel

We get a color wheel by taking the spectrum of light and then connect both ends to a circle. It’s really helpful in telling us the relationships between the colors. How so? For starters, the color wheel can easily tell you how to create the biggest color contrast possible for a particular choice. This is often very useful when you decide on a color palette for your project. 

{% img /images/Color-101/GoetheFarbkreis.png %}

The color wheel we are going to cover here is based on the Red-Yellow-Blue (RYB) color model. This one is derived from how painters created their color mixtures—via subtractive color mixing. It’s mostly used in art and design these days. It predates the scientific color theory—which we won’t cover in this article—that relies on cyan, magenta and yellow (CMY) as its primary colors and achieve a bigger subset of colors with it. What we are going to use is the traditional “artist’s” color wheel.

This color wheel is not so much of a scientific thing but more a representation of how our brain works—maybe even how we respond emotionally in terms of what responses colors awake—maybe also very much influenced by centuries of art history. By scientifically, I mean there are no opposite colors in that regard—that’s only in our brains or in the concepts we put together to organize / distinguish colors. It’s definitely helpful for choosing color though.

### Primary Colors: Red, Yellow, Blue

{% img /images/Color-101/GoetheFarbkreis-Primary-Colors.png %}

They are used to create all other colors—therefore primary. You can’t mix any other colors to get them. In that way, they are like constants if you will—they are fixed. This is certainly a good starting point and everything you need to know about primary colors for now. That being said, I also want to mention that this was the assumption of many color theorists in the past. In reality, with paint or ink for example, you can only mix a limited range of colors which does not match the complete range a healthy human eye can perceive. What we’re talking about here is a certain complete subset of colors, also called a gamut. So, a grain of salt is in order here.

### Secondary Colors: Green, Orange, Purple

{% img /images/Color-101/GoetheFarbkreis-Secondary-Colors.png %}

These colors are mixed by combining primary colors. In Goethe’s color wheel above, green forms the base. It’s the blend of the two primary colors yellow and blue. Orange is a mix of yellow and red while purple is a mixed with red and blue. Tertiary colors take this idea further and mixes primary with secondary colors—again mixing colors that lie next to each other on the wheel. After finishing this declination you get:

+ amber: yellow-orange
+ vermilion: red-orange
+ magenta: red-purple
+ violet: blue-purple
+ teal: blue-green
+ chartreuse: yellow-green

Note that the secondary color follows the primary color in this notation. Easier to remember I guess.

## Types of color

###### Newer representation of the RYB color wheel:

{% img /images/Color-101/New-color-wheel2.png %}

### Warm Colors

Warm colors, which are represented by the right side of the color wheel.
They are more attention grabbing, energetic, really strong—at least in our usual perception. Don’t forget these are very human attributes that have nothing to do with the phenomenon of light. These colors can grab our attention really fast and are considered very active.

### Cool Colors

The left side on the other hand represent cool colors. These are more comforting and stable. They also tend to fade to the background of a composition easily and don’t “jump out” that much. So they are considered more passive in nature. I think of it this way: On the web, t’s all about quick perceptions and in this regard about colors that don’t not raise any “red” flags (pun intended) among your users.

This left side of the color wheel is very popular among popular websites these days. Just take a look at the Facebooks and Twitters out there and you will find a plethora of well-known projects making these colors intrinsic to their color palettes. Why? Because web projects always have to fight the disadvantage of not being physical where a personal connection can be made more easily and more speedy. Websites that cater to a gazillion people need to appear stable, trustworthy, relaxing and calm—even comforting. These are all things that the cooler types of color can help you with. 

### Neutral Colors

Black, white and brown are considered neutral. In that sense, they are supporting “colors”. If applied right, these neutrals can bind everything together—like in the Monet painting above. They provide a break from the intensity of the brighter, more intense colors which attract the eye more easily. In that sense, neutrals are the foundation of interest and variation—like your spaghetti with tomato sauce and meatballs. The spaghettis are the neutral binder in all of this.

The neutrals recede to the background when you bring more saturated colors into the mix. In every great color vocabulary, they play an important part because they help you to create a skillful balance in your work. Just imagine if everything is shouting color-wise. That wouldn’t be very effective and we would again end up with color “noise”. Neutrals are your secret weapon to create a sharp focus where needed. In practical terms, this means that you build up your composition with mostly neutral tones and then decide where the focus is and where the eye is supposed to be attracted to. That’s where the saturated tones come into play.






???The three dark colors, dark spectrum -> secondary colors?
The three light colors, light spectrum -> primary colors?
Goethe incorporated both light and dark spectra in his color wheel, he called it the harmonic color wheel -> which we use today

## Color Harmonies

     Some color look better together than others. Probably a term that comes from musical harmonies.

### Monochromatic
     easy
     one color
     single subjects
     details of image focus

### Analogous Colors

     Adjacent on the color wheel
     Easy on the eyes
     Peaceful, comfortable mood -> often seen in nature
     Right next to each other on the color wheel
     creating a realationship
     right direction for matching colors

### Triadic Colors

     Equally distant on the wheel
     Hard to get right
     More of an advanced combination
     Good for cartoon and surreal scenes
     Can imply playfulness

### Complimentary Colors

     Opposing each other on the wheel
     Very popular combination
  “Naturally” pleasing to the eye
Don’t use them equally -> decide on one dominant color -> generally the weaker color (-> the colder color more??)
  Red and green especially popular


  oppposite on the color wheel
  like serif and sans serif in typography
  they work really well together 
  About color contrast as well
  contrast well to each other
  good first step usually

  There are more variations but this should give you a great start for now.

## Matching Colors

  Similar to choosing typefaces
  Choose one or utmost two major, design dominating colors
  A “primary” color
  Keep it simple
  Start with one dominant color
  Slowly put colors in
  Bounce other colors off of that
  Support and enhance dominant colors with supporting colors
  -> Adjust value, tone, brightness, saturation or use neutral colors
  Color scheme by bouncing off the main color

## Emphasis

  If you use your primary color very sparsely, you can create a very effective emphasis. 
  You want to avoid washing it down too much and waste the opportunity to hightlight key design elements
  focus on elements
  works great with gray scale usually
  save it for important stuff
  very sparsely
  very dominant on the page
  pop forward
  other colors fade back that way and support main color

## Consistency

  Keeping links the same color that do the same thing
  Keeping header colors consistent
  keeping background colors that similar
  most acitionable items can stick out-> not consistent
  mental map
  A lot more classy look achieve
  Setting expectations that you want to make easy for users to follow and understand

## Color Meaning

  In various cultures, colors can imply different meanings or associations.
  Also evoke different feelings therefore
  Need to take that into consideration if you design for different cultures
  These are bit silly in my opinion but it’s nevertheless good to have seen these associations and commit them to memory. Everybody sees colors differently. Maybe for we stuff where you  don’t have to mix a ton of colors to create skin tons for example this is alright, but imagine useing these guidelines when you paint a stilleben with a vase of flowers in front of an open window looking out to a farm. It would be silly to think about all these color associations, no?

## Color Palletes

  On occasion steal and adapt them for your own designs
  See how designers use color pairs
  Learning through imitations is fine

  ... Website list for color palettes

## Color Relativity

Color is only what’s surrounding it

  We were talking about cooler and warmer colors but it’s a bit more relative that that. Color can appear that way in reltation to another. Colors can look warmer or colder depending on the enviroment they are in. Our human eye is a bit foolish that way.

{% img /images/Color-101/color-relativity.png %}

## Final Thoughts

can be powerful mood changer

Try to avoid having muddy colors where you loose the distinct quality the colors at your disposal. On the web, you definitely want to use color to create a certain mood, vibe or whatever and also to highlight stuff that are of particular importance. As with design principles, less is more. If everything is highlighted via color, nothing sticks out and you will end up with color noise—which is the worst becaus it is not interesting at all.

Color is an insanely deep rabbit hole. Don’t get lost in it too much! You have a lifetime to to achieve probably only a fraction of an understanding. Take it easy and have fun!
