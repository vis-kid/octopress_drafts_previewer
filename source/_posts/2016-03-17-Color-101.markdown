## Color?

Without light there is no color right? Well, actually without “darkness” there is no color either. Huh? I know, sounds strange at first but without darkness, colors disappear as well. Do we need to know stuff like this when we pick colors on our computers—choosing its hue, saturation and value? Probably not! Could color theory blow your mind every once in a while and make you a more effective web designer and therefore communicator? Absolutely! In terms of colors we all have a ton of opinions and emotions but often people have not a clear idea what they are actually doing. Going with your gut is fine of course but having a theoretic basis to build upon makes you much more effective as a design person. Art school is not something most people spend a significant time of their lives, but you don’t need to spend years to bend color to our needs. So let’s get you up to speed.

With colors there are a lot of considerations you wouldn’t expect right away. A little bit of a warning, it can be a rabbit hole you never get out of—and we are not even talking about branding and stuff. To compensate for that, I propose that first and foremost, you might focus on making it interesting for your users while making reasonable and effective choices that support your design. This seems like a manageable goal for color newbies. I realize this sounds super puffy, but subjectivity is not something that you can shake off when talking about colors. Let’s just say that we can agree that choosing colors that have meaning and create interest is a good place to start.

Color can be a very powerful “weapon” in your artistic or creative repertoire—if yielded appropriately of course. On the other hand, nothing makes you look like a poser as fast as ill considered appliance of color. Trust me, I’ve been there and in hindsight you want to kick yourself hard for not paying more attention. For our designs, color is about the emotional and visual impact. If used correctly, they can guide viewers to what’s important and adds emphasis if you don’t overdo it. I guess it’s fair to say that this is probably the most important thing when using color on web projects. A secondary concern is that you can establish a certain mood, an emotional impact that takes branding ideas even further. This whole topic is a HUGE one—gigantic actually. We will focus on the most important aspects and terms to get you started.

Try to avoid having muddy colors where you loose the distinct quality the colors at your disposal. On the web, you definitely want to use color to create a certain mood, vibe or whatever and also to highlight stuff that are of particular importance. As with design principles, less is more. If everything is highlighted via color, nothing sticks out and you will end up with color noice—which is the worst becaus it is not interesting at all.

can be powerful mood changer


No light, no color. The color disappears. Without darkness, the colors disappear too.
Light and darkness together make colors visible.

## Hue

A hue is any color on the color wheel.

{% img /images/Color-101/Hue-scale.png %}

Most of the time when people talk about colors, they are actually talking about hues which are the basic, pure colors. That means any color that is within the visible light spectrum. The healthy human eye can see 2.3 Mio hues. These don’t have tint or shade—which means they lack any additions of white or black (see next section).
So tons of different variations of reds, blues, greens and so on.

For our work with colors in design, they represent starting points, like raw, most primitive versions we need to leave behind to avoid looking amateurish or childish. Did you ever notice that cartoons for kids like to use these colors for their characters? Not a big surprise I guess. You can make use of this of course if you go for a certain look but most of the time childish is not what works too well on the web. 

## Tint, Shade & Tone

We are talking about tints and shades of particular hues. Tint is about the amount of white in a color. When you mix a color with white you are tinting it. This leads to increased lightness of the hue the more white you add. Adding white to the pure hue decreases its saturation. They make the hue less intense. 

Shade on the other hand is about the amount of black in a color. When you mix a color with black you are shading it. This leads to reduced lightness of the hue the more black you add. This results in a rich, often darker more intense color due to the overpowering nature of black pigments. Many blacks change the characteristics of a hue—even through small amounts. Therefore they should be used sparingly.

###### Tint-Hue-Shade Spectrum:

{% img /images/Color-101/tint-shade-spectrum.png 800 %}

As you can see here, in the middle is the pure hue. Towards the left direction, we add more and more white by tinting it and to the right we are shading the red with black.

We speak of creating tones when we mix a hue with gray—which means that you effectively tint and shade it because adding both white and black results in some sort of gray of course. Tones can be lighter or darker than the original hue—depending on the amount of white and black added. They will also appear less saturated and intense than the original hue. Tones can reveal subtle and complex qualities in a hue. They are closer to the way we see the “real” world.

{% img /images/Color-101/tint-tone-shade.png %}

The tone of a hue is its relative darkness / lightness. It’s about the amount of light that is reflected by that hue. The lighter the more light get’s reflected back and the darker the more light gets absorbed. 

## Value

A lot of the great paintings we admire in art history were done by artists that were masters at tonal contrast.

gray scale

works nice if you work monochromatically, meaning with one color or hue.

The lights and shades of a hue??

monochrome, it goes from light to dark

The relative shades of an object

if you bring tonal contrast in, light and shade, more vibrant, interesting and professional result


Variations of depth are created by gradual values changes.

When we talk about something is bright or dark, we are talking about the value of a hue. This tells us how close it is to 

Value is the lightness or darkness of a hue In paintings, color changes can be achieved very effectively by adding black or white. Artists set up simple gray scales for consistency in their work.

{% img /images/Color-101/color-scale.png %}

A value scale is like a gray scale for a particular hue.

{% img /images/Color-101/color-schemes-monochromatic.png %}

Values are very, very important
They are much more important to get correct than color

The sections on the scale are called steps. They are significant color steps that can be clearly distinguished by being significantly lighter or darker than the next step 

Every color has its own inherent range of values

{% img /images/Color-101/color-values-mirrored.png %}

Value is in the low gray-scale range, the value is very dark
Yellow on the other hand is in the high-range

Blue has a larger range, from dark to light

Color is only what’s surrounding it

Always start with some color on the page
The other colors are in relation to that

IN general you want more desaturated tones,  pure hues are immature


With pencil you are drawing with values only and you can achieve a beautiful image with values only. darks and lights

{% img /images/Color-101/ART_VALUE_SCALE.png %}


Grayscale aka value scale
refers to the range of lightness and darkness, the lightest light to the darkest dark

The tints or shades of a hue define a degree of lightness or darkness of a hue.


{% img /images/Color-101/Odin_disguised_as_a_Traveller_value_scale.png %}

The values does not change when you have color on

{% img /images/Color-101/Andreas_Achenbach_Clearing_Up—Coast_of_Sicily_Walters-grayed-out.png %}

{% img /images/Color-101/Andreas_Achenbach_Clearing_Up—Coast_of_Sicily_Walters.jpg %}

why do we care?
values are a way to render a two-dimensional image on paper, browsers or a canvas to let it appear three-dimensional—what people call more alive or vibrant. In contrast to flat colors that fail to achieve this effect.


monochromatic, different values of a hue. differnt types of a hue if you will

## Chroma

Everything added from the opposite of the color wheel will desaturate the hue

Chroma, the saturation, is another term we should not overlook. It’s the “colorfulness” of a hue. That funky term just translates to the intensity or brilliance of a perceived color. The chroma is defining how pure the hues is. When you buy colors for painting, chromas are the colors that you take right off the tube. In constrast to that, desaturation means that the color is washed out or grayed out. These colors are often used as shadow colors.

Remember to desaturate a hue by adding a complimentary color. It’s important to understand that we are not adding gray for this. In effect you are creating a gray but not by adding black or white. These grays are used by paintrs to break up saturated colors. Why is that a good idea? You don’t want to bombard viewers with intense color saturations everywhere—quite the contrary.

Take blue and orange for example. Next to each other they would be very intense. If you mix these colors you have this gray tone that can separate them really well. The color stands in between those highly saturated ones.

###### “Impression, soleil levant” by Claude Monet

{% img /images/Color-101/Claude_Monet,_Impression.jpg %}


More vibrancy, more life.

Create a barrier between the colors to percevie them separately. When you talk about masters in painting, this is one of the things they tried to master.

Good if you wanna focus on only one or two colors
creating variatons on that
playing with main colors
more options
playing off of it
within the same color
vary your color but stay wihint same color choice

highly saturated colors can look incredibly fake.
too much of it gives your eyes not much rest

anchor your eyes or the viewers attention when only few parts are selectivly highly saturated

The more of the opposite color you add the more you desaturate it, the less pure it becomes. It becomes more dull. We are dealing with intensity. Where both colors meet, you have your neutral color point -> brown, gray

## The Grays

Are a mix of the shadow colors, which is the desaturated version by mixing it with its complimentary color, and mixing the shadow color with white.

## Color Wheel

The three dark colors, dark spectrum -> secondary colors?
The three light colors, light spectrum -> primary colors?
Goethe incoroprated both light and dark spectra in his color wheel, he called it the harmonic color wheel -> which we use today
Green forms the base of Goethes color wheel. It’s the blend of the two primary colors yellow and blue
Magenta forms the top of the color wheel. It arises as a blend of red and violet


!!!We get a color wheel by taking the spectrum of light and through connecting both ends to a circle.
Relationships between the colors
The color wheel can easily tell you how to create the biggest color contrast possible
The color wheel is not so much of a scientific thing but more how our brain works—maybe even emotional in terms of contrast and what respsones color awake. By scientifially, I mean there are not opposite colors in that regard—that’s only in our brains or in the concepts we put together to organize / distinguish colors.
helps to choose color

Primary colors: Red, Yellow, Blue
You can’t mix any other colors to get them. -> are like constants if you like. fixed
Can not be made by mixing ohter colors
Are used to create all other colors

Secondary colors: Green, orange, purple
are mixed from primary colors

Tertiary colors 




Two types of color:

## Warm Colors


Right side of the color wheel
more attention grabbing,
     strong, engergetic, really strong, fast attention
     render problems??
     color vibrate
     active colors

     You can also have a cold red and a warm red
     But you can also have warm blue and cold blue for example


## Cool Colors

     Green, blue, purple
     Left side of the color wheel
     Tend to fade into the background
     calm, stable, recede on page
     more comforting, stable, enriching
     usually a save bet, very popular
     lots of site online using it,
     does not jump out so much
     passive colors


     Golden aera
     Feeling blue

## Netural Colors

     Neutral colors taking two complimentary paris
     get gray or brown neutral
     on the other side is saturation
     neturals bind everything together
     provide a break from the intensity of the bright colors
     bright colors attract the eye
     neutrals provide interest and variation
     combined with saturated colors, neutrals recede while saturated come forward, at you.
     neutrals are very versatile
     they are part of a great color vocabulary
     subtle, subtle colors
     they create a balance in your work
     if everything is shouting, I mean highly saturated, pure color, nothing is focused. Seems also really flat
     build up with mostly neutral tones. then decide where the focus is and where the eye is supposed to be attracted to. that’s where you put the saturated tones
     Tone everything down, don’t make it so bright
     Everything bright seems childish and amateurish
     not within color wheel
     supporting colors
     black, brown, white
     ?? Gray scale??

## Color Harmonies

     Some color look better together than others. Probably a term that comes from musical harmonies.

### Monochromatic
     easy
     one color
     single subjects
     details of image focus

### Analogous Colors

     Adjacent on the color wheel
     Easy on the eyes
     Peaceful, comfortable mood -> often seen in nature
     Right next to each other on the color wheel
     creating a realationship
     right direction for matching colors

### Triadic Colors

     Equally distant on the wheel
     Hard to get right
     More of an advanced combination
     Good for cartoon and surreal scenes
     Can imply playfulness

### Complimentary Colors

     Opposing each other on the wheel
     Very popular combination
  “Naturally” pleasing to the eye
Don’t use them equally -> decide on one dominant color -> generally the weaker color (-> the colder color more??)
  Red and green especially popular


  oppposite on the color wheel
  like serif and sans serif in typography
  they work really well together 
  About color contrast as well
  contrast well to each other
  good first step usually

  There are more variations but this should give you a great start for now.

## Matching Colors

  Similar to choosing typefaces
  Choose one or utmost two major, design dominating colors
  A “primary” color
  Keep it simple
  Start with one dominant color
  Slowly put colors in
  Bounce other colors off of that
  Support and enhance dominant colors with supporting colors
  -> Adjust value, tone, brightness, saturation or use neutral colors
  Color scheme by bouncing off the main color

## Emphasis

  If you use your primary color very sparsely, you can create a very effective emphasis. 
  You want to avoid washing it down too much and waste the opportunity to hightlight key design elements
  focus on elements
  works great with gray scale usually
  save it for important stuff
  very sparsely
  very dominant on the page
  pop forward
  other colors fade back that way and support main color

## Consistency

  Keeping links the same color that do the same thing
  Keeping header colors consistent
  keeping background colors that similar
  most acitionable items can stick out-> not consistent
  mental map
  A lot more classy look achieve
  Setting expectations that you want to make easy for users to follow and understand

## Color Meaning

  In various cultures, colors can imply different meanings or associations.
  Also evoke different feelings therefore
  Need to take that into consideration if you design for different cultures
  These are bit silly in my opinion but it’s nevertheless good to have seen these associations and commit them to memory. Everybody sees colors differently. Maybe for we stuff where you  don’t have to mix a ton of colors to create skin tons for example this is alright, but imagine useing these guidelines when you paint a stilleben with a vase of flowers in front of an open window looking out to a farm. It would be silly to think about all these color associations, no?

## Color Palletes

  On occasion steal and adapt them for your own designs
  See how designers use color pairs
  Learning through imitations is fine

  ... Website list for color palettes

## Color Relativity

  We were talking about cooler and warmer colors but it’s a bit more relative that that. Color can appear that way in reltation to another. Colors can look warmer or colder depending on the enviroment they are in. Our human eye is a bit foolish that way.
