+ ### Smelly Code

The following short series of articles is meant for slightly more experienced Ruby developers and starters alike. I had the impression that code smells and their refactorings can be very daunting and intimidating to newbies—especially if they are not in the fortunate position to have mentors who can turn mystical programming concepts into shining light bulbs.

So what are we talking about exactly when people mention code smells? Is it always a problem in your code? Not necessarily! Can you avoid them completely? I don’t think so! Do you mean code smells are broken code? Well, sometimes and sometimes not. Should it be my priority to fix them right away? Same answer I fear, sometimes yes and sometimes you certainly should fry bigger fish first. Are you insane? Fair question at this point! Before you continue diving into this whole smelly business, remember to take away one thing from all of this: Don’t try to fix every smell you encounter—this is most certainly a waste of your time!

It seems to me that code smells are a bit hard to wrap up in a nicely labeled box. There are all kinds of smells with various different options to address them. I imagine also that different programming languages and framework are prone to different kind of smells—but there are definitely a lot of common “genetic” strains among them. My attempt to describe code smells is to compare them with medical symptoms that tell you that you might have a problem. They can point to all sorts of latent problems and have a wide variety of solutions if diagnosed.

Thankfully its not as complicated as dealing with the human body—and psyche of course. Its a fair comparison though because some of these symptoms need to be treated right away and some others give you ample time to come up with a solution that is best for the “patient’s” overall well-being. If you have working code and you run into something smelly you’ll have to make the hard decision if its worth the time to find a fix and if that refactoring improves the stability of your app. That being said, if you stumble upon code which you can improve right away its good advice to leave the code behind a bit better—even a tiny bit better adds up substantially over time.

#### Resistance

If the quality of your code makes the inclusion of new code harder—like deciding where to put new code is a pain or comes with a lot of ripple effects throughout your codebase for example—you’ll experience resistance from your existing code. As a guideline for code quality you can measure it always by how easy it is to introduce changes. If that is getting harder and harder its definitely time to refactor and to take the last part of *red-green-REFACTOR* more seriously in the future.

+ ### Large Class / God Class

Let’s start with something fancy sounding—“God classes”—because I think they are particular easy to grasp for beginners. God classes are a special case of a code smell called **Large Class**. In this section I’ll address both of them. If you have spent a little bit of time in Rails land you probably have seen them so often that they look normal to you. 

You surely remember the “fat models, skinny controller” mantra? Well actually, skinny is good for all these classes but as a guideline its good advice for newbies I suppose. God classes are objects that attract all sorts of knowledge and behaviour like a black hole. Your usual suspects most often include the User model and whatever problem (hopefully ;) your app is trying to solve—first and foremost at least. A todo app might bulk up on the **Todos** model, a shopping app on **Products**, a photo app on **Photos**—you get the drift. People call them god classes because they know too much. They have too many connections with other classes—mostly because someone was lazy modeling them. It is hard work though to keep God classes in check. They make it really easy to dump more responsibilities onto them and as lots of greek heroes would attest, it takes a bit of skill to divide and conquer “gods”.

The problem with them is that they become harder and harder to understand, especially for new team members, harder to change and reuse becomes less and less of an option the more gravity they amassed. Oh yeah, you’re right, your tests are unnecessarily harder to write as well. In short, there is not really an upside to having large classes and god classes in particular.

There are a couple of common symptoms / signs that your class needs some heroism / surgery:

+ You need to scroll!
+ Tons of private methods?
+ Does your class have seven or more methods on it?
+ Hard to tell what your class really does—concisely!
+ Does your class have many reasons to change when your code evolves?

Also, if you squint at your class and think “Eh? Ew!” you might be on to something too. If all that sounds familiar, chances are good that you found yourself a fine specimen. 

``` ruby
class CastingInviter
  EMAIL_REGEX = /\A([^@\s]+)@((?:[-a-z0-9]+\.)+[a-z]{2,})\z/

  attr_reader :message, :invitees, :casting

  def initialize(attributes = {})
    @message  = attributes[:message]  || ''
    @invitees = attributes[:invitees] || ''
    @sender   = attributes[:sender]
    @casting  = attributes[:casting]
  end

  def valid?
    valid_message? && valid_invitees?
  end

  def deliver
    if valid?
      invitee_list.each do |email|
        invitation = create_invitation(email)
        Mailer.invitation_notification(invitation, @message)
      end
    else
      failure_message  = "Your #{ @casting } message couldn’t be sent. Invitees emails or message are invalid"
      invitation = create_invitation(@sender)
      Mailer.invitation_notification(invitation, failure_message )
    end
  end

  private

  def invalid_invitees
    @invalid_invitees ||= invitee_list.map do |item|
      unless item.match(EMAIL_REGEX)
        item
      end
    end.compact
  end

  def invitee_list
    @invitee_list ||= @invitees.gsub(/\s+/, '').split(/[\n,;]+/)
  end

  def valid_message?
    @message.present?
  end

  def valid_invitees?
    invalid_invitees.empty?
  end

  def create_invitation(email)
    Invitation.create(
      casting:       @casting,
      sender:        @sender,
      invitee_email: email,
      status:        'pending'
    )
  end
end
```

Can you see how much nastyness is bundled in here? Of course I put a little cherry on top, but you will run into code like this sooner or later.  Let’s think about what responsibilities this **CastingInviter** class has to juggle. 

+ Delivering email
+ Checking for valid messages and email addresses
+ Getting rid of white space
+ Splitting email addresses on commas and semicolons

Should all of this be dumped on a class which just wants to deliver a casting call via **deliver**? Certainly not! If your method of invitation changes you can expect to run into some [Shotgun surgery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shotgun_surgery). CastingInviter doesn’t need to know most of these details. That’s more the responsibility of some class that is specialized in dealing with email related stuff. You’ll find many reasons to change your code as well. 

### Extract Class

So how should we deal with this? Often, extracting a class is a handy refactoring pattern that will present itself as a reasonable solution to such problems as big, convoluted classes—especially when the class in question deals with multiple responsibilities. Private methods are often good candidates to start with—and easy too. Sometimes you’ll need to extract even more than one class from such a bad boy—just don’t do it all in one step. Once you find enough coherent meat that seems to belong into a specialized object of its own you can extract that functionality into a new class.

You create a new class and gradually move the functionality over—one by one. Move each method separately and rename them if you see the reason to. Then reference the new class in the orignal one and delegate the needed functionality. Good thing you have test coverage (hopefull!) that lets you check if things still work properly every step of the way. Aim at being able to reuse your extracted classes as well. Its easier to see how its done in action so lets read some code:

``` ruby
class CastingInviter

  attr_reader :message, :invitees, :casting

  def initialize(attributes = {})
   @message  = attributes[:message]  || ''
   @invitees = attributes[:invitees] || ''
   @casting  = attributes[:casting]
   @sender   = attributes[:sender]
 end

  def valid?
    casting_email_handler.valid?
  end

  def deliver
    casting_email_handler.deliver
  end

  private

  def casting_email_handler
    @casting_email_handler = CastingEmailHandler.new(
      message:  message, 
      invitees: invitees, 
      casting:  casting, 
      sender:   @sender)
  end
end
```

``` ruby
class CastingEmailHandler 
  EMAIL_REGEX = /\A([^@\s]+)@((?:[-a-z0-9]+\.)+[a-z]{2,})\z/

  def initialize(attr = {})
    @message  = attr[:message]  || ''
    @invitees = attr[:invitees] || ''
    @casting  = attr[:casting]
    @sender   = attr[:sender]
  end

  def valid?
    valid_message? && valid_invitees?
  end

  def deliver
    if valid?
      invitee_list.each do |email|
        invitation = create_invitation(email)
        Mailer.invitation_notification(invitation, @message)
      end
    else
      failure_message  = "Your #{ @casting } message couldn’t be sent. Invitees emails or message are invalid"
      invitation = create_invitation(@sender)
      Mailer.invitation_notification(invitation, failure_message )
    end
  end

   private

   def invalid_invitees
    @invalid_invitees ||= invitee_list.map do |item|
      unless item.match(EMAIL_REGEX)
        item
      end
    end.compact
  end

  def invitee_list
    @invitee_list ||= @invitees.gsub(/\s+/, '').split(/[\n,;]+/)
  end

  def valid_invitees?
    invalid_invitees.empty?
  end

  def valid_message?
    @message.present?
  end

  def create_invitation(email)
    Invitation.create(
      casting:       @casting,
      sender:        @sender,
      invitee_email: email,
      status:        'pending'
    )
  end
end
```

In this solution, you’ll not only see how this separation of concerns affects your code quality, it also reads a lot better and becomes easier to digest. Here we delegate methods to a new class that is specialized in dealing with delivering these invitations via email. You have one dedicated place that checks if the messages and invitees are valid and how they need to be delivered. **CastingInviter** doesn’t need to know anything about these details so we delegate these responsibilities to a new class **CastingEmailHandler**.

The knowledge of how to deliver and check for validity of these casting invitation emails is now all contained in our new extracted class. Do we have more code now? You bet! Was it worth it to separate concerns? Pretty sure! Can we go beyond that and refactor **CastingEmailHandler** some more? Absolutely! Knock yourself out!

In case you’re wondering about the **valid?** method on **CastingEmailHandler** and **CastingInviter**. This one is for RSpec to create a custom matcher. This lets me write something like

``` ruby
expect(casting_inviter).to be_valid
```

Pretty handy I think.

There are more techniques for dealing with large classes / god objects and over the course of this series you’ll learn a couple of ways to refactor such objects. There is no fixed prescription how you need to deal with these cases—it always depends and its a case-by-case judgement call if you need to bring the big guns or if smaller, incremental refactoring techniques oblige best. I know, a bit frustrating at times. Following the [Single Responsibility Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle) (SRP) will go a long way though and is a good nose to follow.

+ ### Long Method

Having methods that got a little big is one of the most common things you encounter as a developer. In general, you want to know at a glance what a method is supposed to do. It should also have only one level of nesting or one level of abstraction. In short, avoid to write complicated methods. I know this sounds hard and it often is. A solution that comes up frequently is extracting parts of the method into one or more new functions. This refactoring technique is called **extract method**—its one of the simplest but none the less very effective. As a nice side effect, your code becomes more readable if you name your methods appropriately.

Let’s take a look at feature specs where you’ll need this technique a lot. I remember getting introduced to *extract method* while writing such feature specs and how amazing it felt when the lightbulb went on. Because feature specs like this are easy to understand they are a good candiate for demonstration. Plus you’ll run into similar scenarios over and over when you write your specs.

**spec/features/some_feature_spec.rb**

``` ruby
feature 'M marks mission as complete' do
  scenario 'successfully' do
    visit_root_path
    fill_in      'Email', with: email
    click_button 'Submit'
    sign_in_as   'M@mi6.com'
    visit missions_path
    click_on     'Create Mission' 
    fill_in      'Mission Name', with: 'Project Moonraker'
    click_button 'Submit'

    within "li:contains('Project Moonraker')" do
      click_on 'Mission completed'
    end

    expect(page).to have_css 'ul.missions li.mission-name.completed', text: 'Project Moonraker'
  end
end
```

As you can easily see, there is a lot going on in this scenario. You go to the index page, sign in and create a mission for the setup, then exercise via marking the mission as complete and finally you verify the behaviour. No rocket science, but also not clean and definitely not composed for reuseability. We can do better than that:

**spec/features/some_feature_spec.rb**

``` ruby
require 'rails_helper'

feature 'M marks mission as complete' do
  scenario 'successfully' do
    sign_in_as 'M@mi6.com'
    create_classified_mission_named 'Project Moonraker'

    mark_mission_as_complete        'Project Moonraker'

    agent_sees_completed_mission    'Project Moonraker'
  end
end

def create_classified_mission_named(mission_name)
  visit missions_path
  click_on     'Create Mission' 
  fill_in      'Mission Name', with: mission_name
  click_button 'Submit'
end

def mark_mission_as_complete(mission_name)
  within "li:contains('#{mission_name}')" do
    click_on 'Mission completed'
  end
end

def agent_sees_completed_mission(mission_name)
  expect(page).to have_css 'ul.missions li.mission-name.completed', text: mission_name
end

def sign_in_as(email)
  visit root_path
  fill_in      'Email', with: email
  click_button 'Submit'
end
```

Here we extracted four methods that can be easily reused in other tests now. I hope its clear that we hit three birds with one stone. The feature is a lot more consise, it reads better and is made up of extracted components without duplication. Let’s imagine you have written all kinds of similar scenarios without extracting these methods and you want to change some implementation. Now you wish you’d taken the time to refactor your tests and have one central place to apply your changes.

Sure there is an even better way to deal with feature specs like this—Page Objects for example—but that’s not our scope for today. I guess that’s all you need to know about extracting methods. You can apply this refactoring pattern everywhere in your code—not only in specs of course. In terms of fequency of use, my guess is that it will be your number one technique to improve the quality of your code. Have fun!
