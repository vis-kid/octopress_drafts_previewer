### Topics

+ Hero Section

+ ### Hero Section

Why don’t we add a small hero section on top of the index site? I want something that gives us an opportunity to brand the podcast site without going full-splashy-marketing-page-apeshit. I strongly trust in “less is more” and moreover, in “don’t insult your users by bombarding them with bs”. Let’s keep it nice and simple.

In this last article we will make use of another part of the Bourbon family and implement a couple of patterns from [Refills](http://refills.bourbon.io/)—which provides a pattern / components library (styled and unstyled) and is built with Bourbon and Neat. Why reinvent the wheel when we can now and then adjust existing ones to our needs. Btw, this project is also maintained by designers at [thoughtbot](https://thoughtbot.com/)—so it’s in very good hands qualitywise.
